      "content": "Once upon a time, there lived a hardworking farmer in a small village. He had three sons who were very lazy. The farmer was worried about his sons' future. One day, he called them and told them that he had hidden a treasure in his field. After the farmer's death, the sons started digging the field day and night in search of the treasure. They dug the entire field but found no treasure. However, because the field was well plowed, they decided to sow seeds. That year, they had a great harvest. The sons finally understood what their father meant by 'treasure.' The treasure was the result of hard work.",
