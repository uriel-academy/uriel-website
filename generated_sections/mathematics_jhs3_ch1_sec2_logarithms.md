## Introduction
Logarithms are an essential mathematical concept that has numerous applications in everyday life. In Ghana, logarithms can be used to solve problems related to compound interest in banking, population growth, and even in calculating the magnitude of earthquakes. For example, if you want to start a small business and need to take a loan from a bank, understanding logarithms can help you calculate the interest and determine the total amount you'll need to pay back over time. Logarithms are also crucial for WAEC/BECE exam preparation, as they are frequently tested in the mathematics section.

## Main Content
### Definition of Logarithms
A logarithm is the power to which a number must be raised to get some other number. For a base $b$ and a positive real number $x$, the logarithm of $x$ to base $b$ is written as $\log_b(x)$. In other words, if $b^y = x$, then $\log_b(x) = y$.

### Common Logarithms and Natural Logarithms
Two of the most commonly used logarithms are:
1. **Common logarithms**: Base 10 logarithms, denoted as $\log(x)$ or $\log_{10}(x)$
2. **Natural logarithms**: Base $e$ logarithms, denoted as $\ln(x)$ or $\log_e(x)$, where $e \approx 2.71828$

### Properties of Logarithms
Logarithms have several important properties that allow us to simplify expressions:

| Property | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Product Rule | $\log_b(MN) = \log_b(M) + \log_b(N)$ |
| Quotient Rule | $\log_b(\frac{M}{N}) = \log_b(M) - \log_b(N)$ |
| Power Rule | $\log_b(M^n) = n\log_b(M)$ |
| Change of Base Rule | $\log_b(x) = \frac{\log_a(x)}{\log_a(b)}$ |

### Solving Logarithmic Equations
To solve equations involving logarithms, follow these steps:
1. Isolate the logarithm on one side of the equation
2. If necessary, use the change of base rule to rewrite the logarithm in a more convenient base
3. Apply the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form
4. Solve the resulting exponential equation

## Worked Examples
1. Simplify the expression: $\log(5) + \log(7) - \log(2)$

Step 1: Apply the product rule and quotient rule:
$\log(5) + \log(7) - \log(2) = \log(5 \cdot 7) - \log(2) = \log(\frac{5 \cdot 7}{2})$

Step 2: Simplify the fraction:
$\log(\frac{5 \cdot 7}{2}) = \log(\frac{35}{2})$

Therefore, $\log(5) + \log(7) - \log(2) = \log(\frac{35}{2})$.

2. Solve the equation: $\log_2(x - 3) = 4$

Step 1: The logarithm is already isolated on the left side of the equation.

Step 2: Apply the definition of logarithms to rewrite the equation in exponential form:
$\log_2(x - 3) = 4$ is equivalent to $2^4 = x - 3$

Step 3: Solve the resulting exponential equation:
$2^4 = x - 3$
$16 = x - 3$
$x = 19$

Therefore, the solution to the equation $\log_2(x - 3) = 4$ is $x = 19$.

3. [IMAGE: A diagram showing a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse $c$ and other sides $a$ and $b$. Label the angle opposite side $a$ as $\theta$.]

In the right-angled triangle shown, if $\log(a) = 1.6$ and $\log(c) = 2.1$, find the value of $\log(b)$.

Step 1: Use the Pythagorean theorem:
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

Step 2: Apply the logarithm to both sides of the equation:
$\log(a^2 + b^2) = \log(c^2)$

Step 3: Use the power rule and product rule:
$2\log(a) + 2\log(b) = 2\log(c)$

Step 4: Substitute the given values and simplify:
$2(1.6) + 2\log(b) = 2(2.1)$
$3.2 + 2\log(b) = 4.2$
$2\log(b) = 1$
$\log(b) = 0.5$

Therefore, $\log(b) = 0.5$.

## Practice Problems
1. Simplify the expression: $2\log_3(5) - \log_3(4) + \log_3(2)$

2. Solve the equation: $\log_5(2x + 1) = 2$

3. If $\log(2) = a$ and $\log(3) = b$, find the value of $\log(12)$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.

Answers:
1. $\log_3(5)$
2. $x = 12$
3. $a + 2b$
