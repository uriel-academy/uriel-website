### Challenges Faced by Political Parties
Political parties in Ghana face various challenges:

- Electoral violence: Intense competition can sometimes result in clashes between party supporters, especially during elections

## Case Study/Example
During the 2020 general elections, the two major political parties, NPP and NDC, campaigned vigorously across the country. In the Ashanti Region, known as an NPP stronghold, the party held massive rallies and engaged in door-to-door campaigns to mobilize supporters. Meanwhile, in the Volta Region, considered an NDC stronghold, the party focused on community engagement and small-scale meetings to maintain its support base. These examples demonstrate how political parties adapt their strategies to different regions and contexts within Ghana.
