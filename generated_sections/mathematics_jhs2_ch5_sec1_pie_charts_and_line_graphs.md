## Introduction
As Ghanaian JHS 2 students, you encounter data in various aspects of your daily life. From analyzing market prices of goods to tracking your mobile money transactions, understanding how to represent and interpret data is a crucial skill. Pie charts and line graphs are two powerful tools that allow you to visualize data effectively. Mastering these concepts will not only help you excel in your BECE exams but also enable you to make informed decisions in your future careers, whether you aspire to be a successful farmer, a business owner, or a financial analyst.

In this chapter, we will explore the world of pie charts and line graphs, learning how to construct them, interpret the data they represent, and apply this knowledge to solve real-world problems. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid foundation in these statistical tools, empowering you to analyze data with confidence and accuracy.

## Main Content
### Pie Charts
A **pie chart** is a circular graph divided into sectors, where each sector represents a proportion of the whole. The size of each sector is determined by the percentage of the total data it represents. Pie charts are useful for displaying the composition of a whole, such as the distribution of crops on a farm or the breakdown of expenses in a household budget.

To construct a pie chart:
1. Calculate the percentage each category contributes to the total.
2. Multiply each percentage by 360° to determine the angle for each sector.
3. Use a protractor to draw the angles and construct the pie chart.

The formula for calculating the angle of a sector:
$$\text{Angle of sector} = \frac{\text{Value of category}}{\text{Total value}} \times 360°$$

| Category | Value | Percentage | Angle |
|----------|-------|------------|-------|
| A        | 25    | 25%        | 90°   |
| B        | 40    | 40%        | 144°  |
| C        | 35    | 35%        | 126°  |

### Line Graphs
A **line graph** is a visual representation of how data changes over time or how two variables are related. Line graphs are created by plotting data points on a coordinate plane and connecting them with straight lines. They are commonly used to display trends, such as changes in market prices, population growth, or temperature variations.

To create a line graph:
1. Identify the independent variable (usually time) and the dependent variable (the quantity being measured).
2. Draw and label the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes with appropriate scales.
3. Plot the data points on the coordinate plane.
4. Connect the points with straight lines.

### Interpreting Pie Charts and Line Graphs
When analyzing pie charts and line graphs, consider the following:
- Identify the main categories or variables represented.
- Look for dominant sectors or trends in the data.
- Compare sizes of sectors or slopes of lines to make comparisons.
- Use the data to draw conclusions and make predictions.

### Solving Problems with Pie Charts and Line Graphs
To solve problems using pie charts and line graphs:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the given information.
2. Determine the type of graph or chart required to answer the question.
3. Analyze the graph or chart, focusing on the relevant data.
4. Perform necessary calculations using the provided data.
5. Interpret the results and provide a clear answer to the question.

## Worked Examples
1. A farmer's land is divided into four crop areas: Maize (50%), Yam (25%), Cassava (15%), and Plantain (10%). If the total land area is 120 hectares, calculate the area allocated to each crop.

Solution:
- Maize: 50% of 120 ha = 0.5 × 120 = 60 ha
- Yam: 25% of 120 ha = 0.25 × 120 = 30 ha
- Cassava: 15% of 120 ha = 0.15 × 120 = 18 ha
- Plantain: 10% of 120 ha = 0.1 × 120 = 12 ha

2. The line graph below shows the population growth of a Ghanaian town over 5 years. Calculate the average annual population increase.

Solution:
- Population increase = 25,000 - 10,000 = 15,000
- Number of years = 5
- Average annual increase = 15,000 ÷ 5 = 3,000 people per year

3. A school canteen sells three types of food: Waakye (45%), Jollof (35%), and Fufu (20%). If the canteen sells a total of 800 plates per day, how many plates of each type of food are sold?

Solution:
- Waakye: 45% of 800 = 0.45 × 800 = 360 plates
- Jollof: 35% of 800 = 0.35 × 800 = 280 plates
- Fufu: 20% of 800 = 0.2 × 800 = 160 plates

## Practice Problems
1. A mobile money agent's transactions in a day consist of Deposits (60%), Withdrawals (30%), and Transfers (10%). If the total transactions amount to GH₵5,000, calculate the value of each type of transaction.

2. The line graph below shows the price of a bag of cement over 6 months. Calculate the percentage increase in the price from Month 1 to Month 6.

3. A survey of 1,200 BECE candidates reveals that 40% prefer Mathematics, 35% prefer Science, and the rest prefer English. Represent this information in a pie chart and calculate the number of candidates who prefer English.

Answers:
1. Deposits: GH₵3,000, Withdrawals: GH₵1,500, Transfers: GH₵500
2. 50% increase
3. English: 25% (300 candidates)
