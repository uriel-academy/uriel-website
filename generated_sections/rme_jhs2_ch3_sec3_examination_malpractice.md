## Introduction
Kofi, Ama, and their classmates at a junior high school in Kumasi are preparing for their upcoming BECE exams. They have been studying hard, but some of their friends are talking about cheating to get higher scores. Kofi and Ama remember the teachings they have learned at church and the mosque about honesty and integrity. They know that examination malpractice is not only against school rules, but goes against their moral and religious values. As they discuss this issue with their friends, they realize how important it is for students across Ghana to understand the seriousness of examination malpractice and commit to avoiding it.

### Religious and Moral Teachings Against Cheating
All major religions practiced in Ghana condemn dishonesty and promote integrity as a core value:

| Religion | Teachings Against Cheating |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Christianity | "Thou shalt not bear false witness" (Exodus 20:16). Jesus emphasized truthfulness in all things. |
| Islam | "And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it]." (Quran 2:42) |  
| African Traditional Religion | Many proverbs and folktales teach that dishonesty brings disgrace and destroys trust in the community. |

Examination malpractice is a form of cheating and deception that goes against these religious and moral commandments. It shows lack of integrity and disrespect for the hard work of honest students.

### Negative Consequences of Examination Malpractice
Engaging in examination malpractice has serious consequences for:
1. **The individual student**
   - Guilty conscience, loss of self-respect and confidence
   - Disciplinary action if caught, like suspension or expulsion
   - Lack of real learning and competence for higher studies or work
2. **Other students and the school**  
   - Unfairly disadvantages honest, hardworking students
   - Damages the credibility and reputation of the school
3. **The education system and wider society**
   - Undermines the validity and value of exam results and certificates
   - Produces unqualified graduates who may pose risks in professional roles
   - Encourages a culture of fraud and corruption from a young age

### Resisting Peer Pressure and Maintaining Integrity 
Many students who cheat say they did it because of pressure from friends or fear of failure. But we must find the courage to stay true to our values, no matter what others are doing. Some tips:
- Remember your religious and moral duties to be honest
- Focus on your own learning goals, not just grades
- Form a study group with trusted friends to prepare well
- Practice saying no to requests to cheat and be ready to explain why
- Inform authorities privately if you are aware of planned malpractice
- Pray or meditate for strength to overcome temptation and do what is right

## Examples
1. During BECE practice exams, Abena's friend begged her to let her copy her Social Studies essay. Abena gently refused, explaining that it would be cheating and she wanted her friend to learn the material herself. She invited her friend to study together after school instead.

2. Kwame heard some classmates discussing a leaked Science exam paper being sold by dishonest officials. He was worried about his own BECE scores, but remembered the Imam's sermon on the importance of honesty. Kwame decided to focus on studying harder and have faith that Allah would reward his efforts.
