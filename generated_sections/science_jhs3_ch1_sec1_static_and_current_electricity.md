## Introduction
Electricity is an essential part of modern life, powering our homes, schools, and industries. In Ghana, we rely on electricity for many activities, from lighting our homes and charging our phones to running large-scale operations like the Akosombo Hydroelectric Dam on the Volta River. The dam generates electricity for Ghana and neighboring countries, contributing to the development of our nation. Understanding the basic principles of electricity is crucial for Ghanaian students, as it will help them appreciate the importance of this valuable resource and potentially contribute to the future development of our country's electrical infrastructure.

Electricity comes in two forms: static electricity and current electricity. Static electricity involves stationary charges, while current electricity involves the flow of electric charges through a conductor. In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of static and current electricity, learning about electric charge, electric current, and simple electric circuits.

## Main Content
### Electric Charge
**Electric charge** is a fundamental property of matter. There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel each other, while unlike charges attract each other. The unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C). Protons have a positive charge, electrons have a negative charge, and neutrons have no charge.

### Electric Current
**Electric current** is the flow of electric charges through a conductor. In most cases, the charges that flow are electrons. The unit of electric current is the ampere (A), which is defined as the flow of one coulomb of charge per second.

### Simple Electric Circuits
A simple electric circuit consists of three main components:
1. A power source (e.g., battery or generator)
2. A conductor (e.g., wires)
3. A load (e.g., light bulb or resistor)

The power source provides the energy needed to move the charges through the circuit. The conductor allows the charges to flow, while the load converts the electrical energy into another form of energy (e.g., light or heat).

### Ohm's Law
**Ohm's law** is a fundamental principle in electrical circuits. It states that the voltage (V) across a conductor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it, with the constant of proportionality being the resistance (R). Mathematically, Ohm's law is expressed as:

V = IR

Where:
- V is the voltage in volts (V)
- I is the current in amperes (A)
- R is the resistance in ohms (Ω)

| Quantity    | Symbol | Unit     |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Voltage     | V      | Volt (V) |
| Current     | I      | Ampere (A) |
| Resistance  | R      | Ohm (Ω)  |

Practical Example: Creating a Simple Circuit with a Lemon Battery
You can create a simple electric circuit using a lemon, copper and zinc electrodes, and an LED.
1. Insert a copper coin and a galvanized nail into a lemon, ensuring they do not touch each other.
2. Connect the positive lead of the LED to the copper coin using a wire.
3. Connect the negative lead of the LED to the galvanized nail using another wire.
4. Observe the LED lighting up, powered by the lemon battery.

The lemon battery works because the citric acid in the lemon acts as an electrolyte, allowing the flow of electrons from the zinc nail (anode) to the copper coin (cathode), creating an electric current.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the current flowing through a 60 W light bulb connected to a 240 V power supply.
   
   Given:
   - Power (P) = 60 W
   - Voltage (V) = 240 V
   
   Step 1: Determine the formula for power.
   Power = Voltage × Current
   P = VI
   
   Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for current.
   I = P ÷ V
   
   Step 3: Substitute the given values and calculate the current.
   I = 60 W ÷ 240 V = 0.25 A
   
   Therefore, the current flowing through the light bulb is 0.25 A.

2. A resistor with a resistance of 100 Ω is connected to a 9 V battery. Calculate the current flowing through the resistor.

   Given:
   - Resistance (R) = 100 Ω
   - Voltage (V) = 9 V
   
   Step 1: Determine the formula for Ohm's law.
   Voltage = Current × Resistance
   V = IR
   
   Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for current.
   I = V ÷ R
   
   Step 3: Substitute the given values and calculate the current.
   I = 9 V ÷ 100 Ω = 0.09 A
   
   Therefore, the current flowing through the resistor is 0.09 A or 90 mA.
