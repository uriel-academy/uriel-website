## Introduction
Imagine living in a community where there are no rules, leaders, or decision-makers. It would be chaotic, wouldn't it? This is where the concept of government comes in. Just like how Kofi's family has rules and his parents make decisions for the household, a country also needs a government to maintain order and ensure the well-being of its citizens.

Ama, a student from Kumasi, is curious about how the government works and what it means to be a citizen of Ghana. In this section, we will explore the fundamentals of government and citizenship, and how they impact our daily lives as Ghanaians.
