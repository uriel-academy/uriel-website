# Chapter 3: Geometry
## Section: Symmetry

### Learning Objectives
After studying this section, students will be able to:
1. Identify and classify different types of symmetry (line, rotational, point) in 2D shapes.
2. Determine the order of rotational symmetry for regular polygons.
3. Draw lines of symmetry and rotational symmetry for various 2D shapes.
4. Apply the properties of symmetry to solve geometric problems.

### Introduction
Symmetry is a fundamental concept in mathematics and is widely observed in our daily lives. In Ghana, we can find numerous examples of symmetry, from the intricate patterns in Kente cloth to the symmetrical structures of buildings like the Independence Arch in Accra. Understanding symmetry is essential for Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE examination, as it forms a significant portion of the geometry questions.

In this section, we will explore the different types of symmetry and learn how to identify and apply them to various shapes. By mastering the concepts of symmetry, students will develop a deeper understanding of geometry and enhance their problem-solving skills, which will be invaluable in their future studies and careers, whether they aspire to become architects, engineers, or designers.

### Main Content
#### Types of Symmetry
There are three main types of symmetry in 2D shapes:
1. **Line symmetry**: A shape has line symmetry if it can be divided into two identical halves by a straight line, called the **line of symmetry**. The two halves are mirror images of each other.
2. **Rotational symmetry**: A shape has rotational symmetry if it can be rotated less than 360° about a fixed point (the **center of rotation**) and still look the same.
3. **Point symmetry**: A shape has point symmetry if, for every point on the shape, there is a corresponding point on the opposite side of the central point (the **point of symmetry**) at an equal distance.

#### Line Symmetry
To determine if a shape has line symmetry, follow these steps:
1. Imagine folding the shape along a straight line.
2. If the two halves of the shape perfectly overlap, the shape has line symmetry, and the fold line is the line of symmetry.
3. A shape can have multiple lines of symmetry.

| Shape                 | Number of Lines of Symmetry |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Square                | 4                          |
| Rectangle             | 2                          |
| Equilateral Triangle  | 3                          |
| Circle                | Infinite                   |

#### Rotational Symmetry
To determine the order of rotational symmetry for a shape, follow these steps:
1. Rotate the shape about its center point.
2. Count the number of times the shape looks the same during one complete rotation (360°).
3. The **order of rotational symmetry** is the number of times the shape looks the same during one complete rotation.

| Shape                 | Order of Rotational Symmetry |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| Square                | 4                            |
| Equilateral Triangle  | 3                            |
| Pentagon              | 5                            |
| Hexagon               | 6                            |

#### Point Symmetry
To determine if a shape has point symmetry, follow these steps:
1. Choose a point inside the shape (usually the center).
2. For each point on the shape, find the corresponding point on the opposite side of the central point at an equal distance.
3. If every point has a corresponding point, the shape has point symmetry.

### Worked Examples
1. A Ghanaian artisan is creating a Kente cloth pattern using a square design. How many lines of symmetry does the square have?

   [IMAGE: Square with lines of symmetry drawn]
   
   Solution:
   - A square has 4 lines of symmetry: 2 diagonals and 2 lines passing through the midpoints of opposite sides.
   - Therefore, the Kente cloth pattern based on a square will have 4 lines of symmetry.

2. A circular plate is divided into 6 equal slices. What is the order of rotational symmetry for the plate?
   
   Solution:
   - The plate can be rotated 6 times during one complete rotation (360°), each time looking the same.
   - Therefore, the order of rotational symmetry for the plate is 6.

3. A farmer in the Ashanti Region has a rectangular plot of land measuring 100 m by 60 m. How many lines of symmetry does the plot have?
   
   [IMAGE: Rectangle with lines of symmetry drawn]
   
   Solution:
   - A rectangle has 2 lines of symmetry: one passing through the midpoints of the longer sides and another passing through the midpoints of the shorter sides.
   - Therefore, the farmer's rectangular plot of land has 2 lines of symmetry.

### Practice Problems
1. A regular pentagon has a center of rotation at its center. What is the order of rotational symmetry for the pentagon?
2. A Ghanaian flag has a black star in the center. Does the flag have point symmetry? Explain your answer.
3. A traditional Ghanaian adinkra symbol is based on a regular hexagon. How many lines of symmetry does the symbol have?

Answers:
1. 5
2. Yes, the flag has point symmetry because for every point on the flag, there is a corresponding point on the opposite side of the black star at an equal distance.
3. 6

### Summary
- The three main types of symmetry in 2D shapes are line symmetry, rotational symmetry, and point symmetry.
- A shape has line symmetry if it can be divided into two identical halves by a straight line called the line of symmetry.
- A shape has rotational symmetry if it can be rotated less than 360° about its center and still look the same. The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times the shape looks the same during one complete rotation.
- A shape has point symmetry if, for every point on the shape, there is a corresponding point on the opposite side of the central point at an equal distance.
- Regular polygons have both line symmetry and rotational symmetry.
