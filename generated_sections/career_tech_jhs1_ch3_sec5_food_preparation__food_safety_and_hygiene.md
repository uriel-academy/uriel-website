## Main Content
### Common Food Safety Hazards
Food safety hazards are factors that can cause harm to consumers if not properly controlled. These hazards can be classified into three main categories:
1. **Biological hazards**: Bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi that can cause foodborne illnesses
2. **Chemical hazards**: Pesticides, cleaning agents, and other harmful substances that can contaminate food
3. **Physical hazards**: Foreign objects such as glass, metal, or plastic that can accidentally enter food during preparation

To prevent these hazards, it is essential to maintain a clean and sanitary environment, handle food properly, and cook ingredients to safe temperatures.

### Personal Hygiene and Protective Equipment
Maintaining personal hygiene is crucial for food handlers to prevent the spread of harmful bacteria and viruses. Key practices include:
- Proper handwashing technique: Wash hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds before handling food, after using the restroom, and after touching raw ingredients
- Use of protective equipment: Wear clean aprons, hairnets, and gloves when preparing food to minimize the risk of contamination

### Food Storage and Preparation
Proper food storage and preparation techniques are essential to prevent spoilage and contamination. Follow these guidelines to ensure food safety:

| Storage Guidelines | Preparation Guidelines |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Store raw meats, poultry, and seafood separately from ready-to-eat foods | Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly before cutting or cooking |
| Keep perishable foods refrigerated at 4°C (40°F) or below | Use separate cutting boards and utensils for raw meats and ready-to-eat foods |
| Store dry goods in clean, sealed containers in a cool, dry place | Cook foods to safe internal temperatures (e.g., 75°C/165°F for poultry) |
| Label and date all stored items to ensure proper rotation | Clean and sanitize surfaces and equipment after each use |

### Safety Precautions
When working with kitchen equipment and hot surfaces, it is crucial to take safety precautions to avoid accidents and injuries. Always follow these safety rules:
- Handle knives and sharp objects with care, keeping fingers away from blades
- Use oven mitts or potholders when handling hot pots, pans, and baking sheets
- Turn pot and pan handles inward to prevent accidental knocking
- Keep flammable items, such as towels and curtains, away from stovetops and open flames
- Have a fire extinguisher readily available and know how to use it properly
