## Introduction
Kofi and Ama, both JHS 2 students in Accra, were walking home from school one day discussing their RME lesson. They had just learned about moral exemplars and were excited to share their thoughts. Kofi mentioned how his pastor at church often spoke about the importance of living a moral life and following the example of Jesus Christ. Ama agreed and added that her imam at the mosque also emphasized the significance of emulating Prophet Muhammad's teachings and actions.
