## Introduction
Mathematics is an essential part of our daily lives in Ghana. From calculating change at the market to measuring ingredients for a favorite dish, we use math every day. Understanding number operations is crucial for managing money, such as counting Ghana cedis or using mobile money services. Farmers need to perform calculations to determine the area of their land and the amount of fertilizer needed. As you prepare for the BECE exam, mastering these skills will help you succeed academically and in your future career.

In this section, we will explore the four basic number operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We will also learn about the order of operations and properties that help us solve problems efficiently. By the end of this section, you will have a strong foundation in number operations and be able to apply these skills to real-life situations.

## Main Content
### Addition and Subtraction
Addition and subtraction are the most basic number operations. Addition combines two or more numbers to find the total, while subtraction finds the difference between two numbers. The symbols for addition and subtraction are **+** and **-**, respectively.

Example:
- Addition: 24 + 13 = 37
- Subtraction: 42 - 19 = 23

Properties of Addition:
| Property | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Commutative | a + b = b + a |
| Associative | (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) |

### Multiplication and Division
Multiplication is repeated addition, while division is the inverse of multiplication. The symbols for multiplication and division are **×** (or **·**) and **÷**, respectively. 

Example:
- Multiplication: 6 × 7 = 42
- Division: 56 ÷ 8 = 7

Properties of Multiplication:
| Property | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Commutative | a × b = b × a |
| Associative | (a × b) × c = a × (b × c) |
| Distributive | a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c) |

### Order of Operations (PEMDAS)
When an expression involves multiple operations, we use the order of operations (PEMDAS) to determine the sequence in which to perform the operations.

1. **P**arentheses
2. **E**xponents
3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)

Example:
Evaluate: 24 + (6 - 2) × 3²
Step 1: Parentheses: 24 + (4) × 3²
Step 2: Exponents: 24 + 4 × 9
Step 3: Multiplication: 24 + 36
Step 4: Addition: 60

### Solving Real-Life Problems
To solve real-life problems involving number operations, follow these steps:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the question being asked.
2. Determine the operation(s) needed to solve the problem.
3. Write an equation or expression representing the problem.
4. Solve the equation or evaluate the expression using the order of operations.
5. Check your answer to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.

Example:
Kofi has GH₵75 in his mobile money account. He receives GH₵120 from his aunt and spends GH₵68 on a new textbook. How much money does Kofi have left in his account?

Step 1: Given information:
- Initial balance: GH₵75
- Money received: GH₵120
- Money spent: GH₵68

Step 2: Operations needed: Addition and subtraction

Step 3: Equation: Final balance = Initial balance + Money received - Money spent

Step 4: Solve: Final balance = 75 + 120 - 68 = 127

Step 5: Check: The final balance of GH₵127 makes sense, as Kofi had more money added to his account than he spent.

Therefore, Kofi has GH₵127 left in his mobile money account.

## Worked Examples
1. Evaluate: 18 + 24 ÷ 3 - 5 × 2
   
   Step 1: Multiplication and Division (left to right): 18 + 8 - 5 × 2
   Step 2: Multiplication: 18 + 8 - 10
   Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (left to right): 26 - 10 = 16

   Answer: 16

2. Ama bought 3 packs of pencils. Each pack contains 12 pencils and costs GH₵4. How much did Ama spend on the pencils?

   [IMAGE: Picture of pencil packs with a price tag]

   Step 1: Given information:
   - Number of packs: 3
   - Number of pencils per pack: 12
   - Cost per pack: GH₵4

   Step 2: Operation needed: Multiplication

   Step 3: Equation: Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack

   Step 4: Solve: Total cost = 3 × 4 = GH₵12

   Answer: Ama spent GH₵12 on the pencils.

3. A farmer has a rectangular plot of land with a length of 120 meters and a width of 80 meters. He wants to fence the plot using 4 rows of wire. Each meter of wire costs GH₵3. Calculate the total cost of the fencing.

   Step 1: Given information:
   - Length of the plot: 120 meters
   - Width of the plot: 80 meters
   - Number of rows of wire: 4
   - Cost per meter of wire: GH₵3

   Step 2: Operations needed: Addition, multiplication

   Step 3: Equation: 
   - Perimeter of the plot = 2 × (Length + Width)
   - Total length of wire needed = Perimeter × Number of rows
   - Total cost = Total length of wire needed × Cost per meter

   Step 4: Solve:
   - Perimeter of the plot = 2 × (120 + 80) = 2 × 200 = 400 meters
   - Total length of wire needed = 400 × 4 = 1,600 meters
   - Total cost = 1,600 × 3 = GH₵4,800

   Answer: The total cost of fencing the plot is GH₵4,800.

## Practice Problems

Answers:
1. 30
2. GH₵180
3. 36 teachers
