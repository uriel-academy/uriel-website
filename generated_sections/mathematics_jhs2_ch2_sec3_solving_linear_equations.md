## Introduction
Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with the manipulation of symbols and equations. In our daily lives as Ghanaian students, we often encounter situations that require algebraic thinking. For example, when buying items at the market, we need to calculate the total cost based on the price per unit and the number of units purchased. We also use algebra when converting between different units of measurement, such as kilograms and grams, or when calculating the amount of money we need to send via mobile money. Moreover, a strong foundation in algebra is essential for success in the BECE and WAEC exams, as it is a key component of the mathematics curriculum.

In this section, we will focus on solving linear equations, which are equations that involve variables raised to the first power (e.g., x, 2y, 3z). Mastering the techniques for solving linear equations will help you develop problem-solving skills and prepare you for more advanced mathematical concepts.

## Main Content
### One-step Linear Equations
A one-step linear equation is an equation that can be solved in one operation, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.

Example:
x + 5 = 12
To solve this equation, subtract 5 from both sides:
x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5
x = 7

### Two-step Linear Equations
A two-step linear equation requires two operations to solve. To solve a two-step linear equation, first perform the addition or subtraction operation, then perform the multiplication or division operation.

Example:
2x - 3 = 9
First, add 3 to both sides:
2x - 3 + 3 = 9 + 3
2x = 12
Then, divide both sides by 2:
2x ÷ 2 = 12 ÷ 2
x = 6

### Translating Word Problems into Linear Equations
Many real-life problems can be solved using linear equations. To solve a word problem, follow these steps:
1. Identify the unknown quantity and assign a variable to it (e.g., x, y, z)
2. Write an equation that represents the problem using the variable
3. Solve the equation
4. Check the solution by substituting it back into the original equation

Example:
Kwame has GH₵150 in his mobile money account. He sends GH₵50 to his sister and GH₵30 to his brother. How much money does Kwame have left in his account?

Let x be the amount of money Kwame has left.
x = 150 - 50 - 30
x = 70
Therefore, Kwame has GH₵70 left in his mobile money account.

### Properties of Equality
When solving linear equations, it is important to understand the properties of equality. These properties allow us to perform operations on both sides of an equation without changing the solution.

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Addition Property of Equality | If a = b, then a + c = b + c |
| Subtraction Property of Equality | If a = b, then a - c = b - c |
| Multiplication Property of Equality | If a = b, then ac = bc |
| Division Property of Equality | If a = b and c ≠ 0, then a ÷ c = b ÷ c |

## Worked Examples
1. Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 25
   3x + 7 - 7 = 25 - 7
   3x = 18
   3x ÷ 3 = 18 ÷ 3
   x = 6

2. Ama bought 5 kilograms of rice at the market. If she paid GH₵30 in total, what was the price per kilogram of rice?
   Let x be the price per kilogram of rice.
   5x = 30
   5x ÷ 5 = 30 ÷ 5
   x = 6
   Therefore, the price per kilogram of rice was GH₵6.

3. [IMAGE: A rectangular farm with a length 3 meters longer than its width]
   The length of a rectangular farm is 3 meters longer than its width. If the perimeter of the farm is 26 meters, find the dimensions of the farm.
   Let x be the width of the farm.
   Length = x + 3
   Perimeter = 2(length + width)
   26 = 2(x + 3 + x)
   26 = 2(2x + 3)
   26 = 4x + 6
   26 - 6 = 4x + 6 - 6
   20 = 4x
   20 ÷ 4 = 4x ÷ 4
   5 = x
   Width = 5 meters
   Length = 5 + 3 = 8 meters

## Practice Problems
1. Solve for y: 2y - 9 = 15
2. Kofi has GH₵200. He spends GH₵60 on a new textbook and GH₵25 on a calculator. How much money does Kofi have left?
3. The sum of three consecutive even numbers is 48. Find the numbers.

Answers:
1. y = 12
2. GH₵115
3. 14, 16, 18
