### What is Teamwork?
**Teamwork** is the ability to work together with others towards a common goal. In a team, each member contributes their skills and ideas to help the group succeed. Effective teams communicate openly, respect each other's opinions, and support one another.

Examples of teamwork in Ghana:
- A group of market vendors working together to keep their area clean and organized
- Tailors in a workshop collaborating to complete a large order of kente cloth garments
- Chefs in a restaurant kitchen coordinating to prepare multiple dishes at once

- **Active listening**: Paying attention when others are speaking and trying to understand their perspective
- **Clear speaking**: Expressing your ideas and opinions in a way that others can easily understand
- **Respectful language**: Using polite and professional words, even when you disagree with someone

Practice active listening by:
1. Making eye contact with the speaker
2. Nodding and using facial expressions to show you are engaged
3. Asking questions to clarify or learn more

1. Assign roles and responsibilities to each team member
2. Set clear goals and deadlines
3. Meet regularly to share progress and ideas
4. Provide constructive feedback and support to your teammates
