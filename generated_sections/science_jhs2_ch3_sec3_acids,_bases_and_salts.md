## Introduction
Acids, bases, and salts play a crucial role in our daily lives here in Ghana. From the tangy taste of fresh lime and the bitterness of cocoa beans to the slippery feel of soap, we encounter these substances all around us. In agriculture, acids and bases in the soil affect crop growth. At the Akosombo Dam, the pH of the water is carefully monitored to prevent corrosion. Understanding the properties and reactions of acids, bases, and salts is essential for many industries, health, and environmental protection in Ghana.

As JHS 2 students, you will learn to identify acids and bases, understand their properties, and explore neutralization reactions that produce salts. You will see how pH affects many aspects of life, from the food we eat to treating diseases like malaria. So let's dive in and discover the fascinating chemistry of acids, bases, and salts!

## Main Content

### Properties of Acids and Bases
**Acids** are substances that produce **hydrogen ions (H+)** when dissolved in water. They have a sour taste, react with metals to produce hydrogen gas, and turn blue litmus paper red. Examples include citric acid in fruits, acetic acid in vinegar, and sulfuric acid in car batteries.

**Bases** are substances that produce **hydroxide ions (OH-)** when dissolved in water. They have a bitter taste, feel slippery, and turn red litmus paper blue. Examples include sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in soap, magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) in antacids, and ammonia (NH3) in cleaning products.

| Property      | Acids                          | Bases                            |
|---------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Taste         | Sour                           | Bitter                           |
| Feel          | Sticky                         | Slippery                         |
| Litmus test   | Turns blue litmus paper red    | Turns red litmus paper blue      |
| pH            | Less than 7                    | Greater than 7                   |
| Examples      | Citric acid, sulfuric acid     | Sodium hydroxide, ammonia        |

### The pH Scale
The **pH scale** measures how acidic or basic a substance is. It ranges from 0 to 14:
- pH < 7: Acidic substances (e.g., lemon juice, vinegar)
- pH = 7: Neutral substances (e.g., pure water)
- pH > 7: Basic substances (e.g., baking soda, milk of magnesia)

### Neutralization Reactions and Salts
When an acid reacts with a base, they neutralize each other to form a **salt** and water. This is called a **neutralization reaction**. The general equation is:

Acid + Base → Salt + Water

For example, when hydrochloric acid (HCl) reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH):

HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)

Salts are ionic compounds that form when the H+ ions from an acid combine with the OH- ions from a base. Common salts include sodium chloride (table salt), potassium nitrate (fertilizer), and calcium carbonate (limestone).

### Practical Experiment: Testing pH with Natural Indicators
You can make your own pH indicators from plants found in Ghana:
1. Crush red cabbage leaves or hibiscus flowers and soak them in hot water.
2. Strain the liquid into a clear container. This is your indicator solution.
3. Add small amounts of various household substances (e.g., lemon juice, baking soda solution, soap) to separate containers.
4. Add a few drops of the indicator to each substance and observe the color changes:
   - Acidic substances turn the indicator red or pink
   - Basic substances turn the indicator blue or green
   - Neutral substances do not change the color significantly

Record your observations in a table:

| Substance      | Indicator Color   | Acidic, Basic, or Neutral |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Lemon juice    | Red               | Acidic                    |
| Baking soda    | Blue              | Basic                     |
| Soap           | Green             | Basic                     |
| Distilled water| Purple (no change)| Neutral                   |

## Worked Examples

1. Calculate the pH of a solution with a hydrogen ion concentration [H+] of 1 × 10^-5 mol/L.

   pH = -log[H+]
      = -log(1 × 10^-5)
      = 5

   The pH of the solution is 5, so it is acidic.

2. When 25 mL of 0.1 M HCl is mixed with 25 mL of 0.1 M NaOH, what salt is formed, and what is its concentration?

   HCl (aq) + NaOH (aq) → NaCl (aq) + H2O (l)

   The salt formed is sodium chloride (NaCl).

   Moles of HCl = Moles of NaOH = 0.025 L × 0.1 mol/L = 0.0025 mol

   Total volume after mixing = 25 mL + 25 mL = 50 mL = 0.05 L

   [NaCl] = (0.0025 mol) / (0.05 L) = 0.05 M

   The concentration of NaCl is 0.05 M.

## Summary
