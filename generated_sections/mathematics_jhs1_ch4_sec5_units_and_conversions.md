## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Identify and convert between different units of measurement for length, mass, and capacity
2. Perform calculations involving units of measurement in real-life scenarios
3. Apply the concept of scale to solve problems involving distances on maps
4. Solve BECE-style problems involving units and conversions

## Introduction
Measurement is a crucial aspect of mathematics that we encounter in our daily lives. In Ghana, we use various units of measurement for different purposes. For example, when buying groceries at the market, we often use kilograms (kg) to measure the mass of items like rice or tomatoes. When traveling between cities, we measure distances in kilometers (km). In school, we learn about measuring the capacity of liquids in liters (L). Understanding units of measurement and how to convert between them is essential for success in mathematics and everyday life.

As you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering units and conversions will help you solve problems accurately and efficiently. You will encounter questions that involve real-life scenarios, such as calculating the cost of goods at the market or determining the distance between two towns on a map. By applying your knowledge of units and conversions, you will be well-equipped to tackle these questions with confidence.

## Main Content

### Units of Length
In the metric system, the basic unit of length is the **meter (m)**. Other common units of length include:
- Centimeter (cm): 1 cm = 0.01 m
- Millimeter (mm): 1 mm = 0.001 m
- Kilometer (km): 1 km = 1000 m

To convert between units of length, we use the following formulas:
| Conversion | Formula |
|------------|---------|
| cm to m    | divide by 100 |
| mm to m    | divide by 1000 |
| km to m    | multiply by 1000 |

For example, to convert 250 cm to meters:
$250 \div 100 = 2.5$ m

### Units of Mass
The basic unit of mass in the metric system is the **gram (g)**. Other common units of mass include:
- Kilogram (kg): 1 kg = 1000 g
- Milligram (mg): 1 mg = 0.001 g

To convert between units of mass, we use the following formulas:
| Conversion | Formula |
|------------|---------|
| kg to g    | multiply by 1000 |
| mg to g    | divide by 1000 |

For example, to convert 3.5 kg to grams:
$3.5 \times 1000 = 3500$ g

### Units of Capacity
The basic unit of capacity in the metric system is the **liter (L)**. Other common units of capacity include:
- Milliliter (mL): 1 mL = 0.001 L
- Centiliter (cL): 1 cL = 0.01 L

To convert between units of capacity, we use the following formulas:
| Conversion | Formula |
|------------|---------|
| mL to L    | divide by 1000 |
| cL to L    | divide by 100 |

For example, to convert 2500 mL to liters:
$2500 \div 1000 = 2.5$ L

### Scale and Distance
Scale is the ratio between the distance on a map and the actual distance in real life. It is often represented as a ratio, such as 1:50,000, which means that 1 unit on the map represents 50,000 units in real life.

To calculate the actual distance using the scale, we use the following formula:
Actual Distance = Map Distance × Scale Factor

For example, if the distance between two towns on a map is 5 cm and the scale is 1:1,000,000, the actual distance would be:
$5 \times 1,000,000 = 5,000,000$ cm = 50 km

## Worked Examples

1. Adwoa bought 2.5 kg of rice and 1.75 kg of beans at the market. What is the total mass of her purchase in grams?

Solution:
First, convert each mass to grams:
- Rice: $2.5 \times 1000 = 2500$ g
- Beans: $1.75 \times 1000 = 1750$ g

Then, add the masses together:
$2500 + 1750 = 4250$ g

Therefore, the total mass of Adwoa's purchase is 4250 grams.

2. Kofi needs to measure the length of his classroom for a school project. He finds that the length is 750 cm. Express this length in meters.

Solution:
To convert centimeters to meters, divide by 100:
$750 \div 100 = 7.5$ m

Therefore, the length of Kofi's classroom is 7.5 meters.

3. On a map with a scale of 1:500,000, the distance between Accra and Kumasi is 12 cm. What is the actual distance between the two cities in kilometers?

[IMAGE: A simple map showing the locations of Accra and Kumasi, with a line connecting them. The distance on the map is labeled as 12 cm.]

Solution:
To find the actual distance, multiply the map distance by the scale factor:
Actual Distance = Map Distance × Scale Factor
Actual Distance = $12 \times 500,000 = 6,000,000$ cm

To convert centimeters to kilometers, divide by 100,000:
$6,000,000 \div 100,000 = 60$ km

Therefore, the actual distance between Accra and Kumasi is 60 kilometers.

## Practice Problems

1. Express 5.2 kg in grams.
2. Convert 240,000 mL to liters.
3. The distance between two points on a map is 8 cm. If the scale of the map is 1:250,000, calculate the actual distance in kilometers.
4. Ama bought 1.5 L of palm oil and 2.25 L of vegetable oil. What is the total volume of oil she purchased in milliliters?

(Answers: 1. 5200 g; 2. 240 L; 3. 20 km; 4. 3750 mL)

## Summary
- The metric system uses standard units for measuring length (meter), mass (gram), and capacity (liter).
- To convert between units, multiply or divide by the appropriate power of 10.
- Scale is the ratio between the distance on a map and the actual distance in real life.
- To calculate the actual distance using the scale, multiply the map distance by the scale factor.
