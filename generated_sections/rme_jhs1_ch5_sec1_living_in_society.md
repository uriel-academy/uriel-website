## Introduction
Kofi and Ama, two junior high school students from Accra, were excited about their upcoming school trip to Kumasi. They knew that Ghana was a diverse country with people from different religious backgrounds, including Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African Religion. As they prepared for their journey, their teacher, Mr. Kwame, reminded them of the importance of respecting and appreciating the differences they would encounter.
