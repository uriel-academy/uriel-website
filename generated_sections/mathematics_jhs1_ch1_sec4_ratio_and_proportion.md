## Introduction
Ratio and proportion are essential mathematical concepts that have numerous applications in everyday life. In Ghana, we use these concepts in various situations, such as:
- Calculating the price of items in the market based on the quantity purchased.
- Exchanging Ghana cedis for other currencies or using mobile money services.
- Determining the amount of fertilizer needed for a farm based on its size.
- Solving problems in the WAEC/BECE exams that involve comparing quantities or sharing resources.

By mastering the concepts of ratio and proportion, students will be well-prepared to tackle real-life challenges and excel in their academic pursuits.

## Main Content
### What is a Ratio?
A **ratio** is a way of comparing two or more quantities. It is written as a fraction, with the quantities separated by a colon (:). For example, if Kofi has 3 balls and Ama has 6 balls, the ratio of Kofi's balls to Ama's balls is 3:6, which can be simplified to 1:2.

To simplify a ratio, divide all quantities by their highest common factor (HCF). For instance, the ratio 12:18 can be simplified to 2:3 by dividing both numbers by their HCF, which is 6.

### Sharing in a Given Ratio
When sharing a quantity in a given ratio, divide the total quantity by the sum of the ratio parts, then multiply the result by each part of the ratio.

For example, if GH₵120 is to be shared between Adwoa and Kwesi in the ratio 2:3, follow these steps:
1. Add the ratio parts: 2 + 3 = 5
2. Divide the total amount by the sum of the ratio parts: GH₵120 ÷ 5 = GH₵24
3. Multiply the result by each part of the ratio:
   - Adwoa's share = 2 × GH₵24 = GH₵48
   - Kwesi's share = 3 × GH₵24 = GH₵72

### What is Proportion?
A **proportion** is an equation stating that two ratios are equal. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar, and you want to use 6 cups of flour, the proportion would be:
$$\frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{x}$$
where $x$ represents the number of cups of sugar needed.

### Solving Problems with Direct and Inverse Proportion
In **direct proportion**, as one quantity increases, the other quantity increases proportionally. For example, the cost of goods is directly proportional to the quantity purchased.

| Quantity (kg) | Cost (GH₵) |
|---------------|------------|
| 1             | 4          |
| 2             | 8          |
| 3             | 12         |

In **inverse proportion**, as one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases proportionally. For example, the time taken to travel a fixed distance is inversely proportional to the speed.

| Speed (km/h) | Time (hours) |
|--------------|--------------|
| 20           | 6            |
| 40           | 3            |
| 60           | 2            |

To solve problems involving direct or inverse proportion, use the unitary method:
1. Find the value of one unit of the given quantity.
2. Multiply the value of one unit by the required quantity.

## Worked Examples
1. A map has a scale of 1:50,000. If the distance between two towns on the map is 8 cm, find the actual distance between the towns in kilometers.
   
   [IMAGE: A line segment labeled "8 cm" representing the distance between two points on a map.]
   
   Solution:
   * Scale = 1:50,000
   * Map distance = 8 cm
   * Actual distance = Map distance × Scale
   * Actual distance = 8 cm × 50,000 = 400,000 cm
   * Convert cm to km: 400,000 cm ÷ 100,000 = 4 km
   
   Therefore, the actual distance between the towns is 4 km.

2. A tap can fill a tank in 6 hours. If the tap is opened for only 2 hours, what fraction of the tank will be filled?
   
   Solution:
   * Time to fill the tank = 6 hours
   * Time the tap is open = 2 hours
   * Fraction of the tank filled = Time the tap is open ÷ Time to fill the tank
   * Fraction of the tank filled = 2 hours ÷ 6 hours = $\frac{1}{3}$
   
   Therefore, $\frac{1}{3}$ of the tank will be filled.

3. Afia and Kwame shared GH₵480 in the ratio 5:3. How much money did each person receive?
   
   Solution:
   * Total amount = GH₵480
   * Ratio = 5:3
   * Sum of ratio parts = 5 + 3 = 8
   * Value of one part = GH₵480 ÷ 8 = GH₵60
   * Afia's share = 5 × GH₵60 = GH₵300
   * Kwame's share = 3 × GH₵60 = GH₵180
   
   Therefore, Afia received GH₵300 and Kwame received GH₵180.

## Practice Problems
1. Express the ratio 54:72 in its simplest form.
2. Share 60 kg of rice among Esi, Kojo, and Yaw in the ratio 2:3:5.
3. If 15 workers can complete a project in 12 days, how long will it take 20 workers to complete the same project? (Assume the workers work at the same rate.)
4. A car travels 240 km in 3 hours. How far will it travel in 5 hours at the same speed?

(Answers: 1. 3:4; 2. Esi: 12 kg, Kojo: 18 kg, Yaw: 30 kg; 3. 9 days; 4. 400 km)
