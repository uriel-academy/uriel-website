## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Identify and classify different types of polygons based on their properties

## Introduction
Geometry is a fascinating branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, and positions of objects. In Ghana, we encounter geometry in our daily lives, from the designs of our traditional kente cloth to the construction of our modern buildings. Understanding the properties of polygons, particularly the angles within them, is crucial for solving real-world problems.

Imagine you are a farmer in the Ashanti Region, and you want to fence your rectangular farm with a perimeter of 200 meters. To determine the dimensions of your farm, you'll need to apply your knowledge of angles and polygons. Or, if you're preparing for the BECE exams, mastering the concepts of angles in polygons will help you excel in the mathematics section and secure a better overall score.

### Types of Polygons
A **polygon** is a closed plane figure with at least three straight sides. Polygons can be classified based on the number of sides they have:

| Number of Sides | Name of Polygon |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| 3               | Triangle        |
| 4               | Quadrilateral   |
| 5               | Pentagon        |
| 6               | Hexagon         |
| 7               | Heptagon        |
| 8               | Octagon         |
| 9               | Nonagon         |
| 10              | Decagon         |

Polygons can also be classified as **regular** or **irregular**. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all angles of equal measure, while an irregular polygon does not have these properties.

### Sum of Interior Angles
The sum of the measures of the interior angles of a polygon depends on the number of sides it has. The formula for the sum of interior angles is:

Sum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180°

where n is the number of sides of the polygon.

For example, the sum of interior angles in a pentagon (5 sides) is:
(5 - 2) × 180° = 3 × 180° = 540°

### Exterior Angles
An **exterior angle** of a polygon is formed by extending one of its sides. The sum of the measures of the exterior angles of any polygon is always 360°.

In a regular polygon, each exterior angle has the same measure, which can be calculated using the formula:

Measure of each exterior angle = 360° ÷ n

where n is the number of sides of the polygon.

For example, in a regular hexagon (6 sides), the measure of each exterior angle is:
360° ÷ 6 = 60°

### Relation between Interior and Exterior Angles
In any polygon, the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. This property can be used to solve problems involving angles in polygons.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1
Calculate the measure of each interior angle in a regular octagon.

Given:
- The polygon is a regular octagon (8 sides)

Step 1: Calculate the sum of interior angles using the formula (n - 2) × 180°
Sum of interior angles = (8 - 2) × 180° = 6 × 180° = 1080°

Step 2: Divide the sum of interior angles by the number of sides to find the measure of each interior angle
Measure of each interior angle = 1080° ÷ 8 = 135°

Therefore, each interior angle in a regular octagon measures 135°.

### Example 2
In a regular polygon, each exterior angle measures 24°. How many sides does the polygon have?

Given:
- Each exterior angle measures 24°

Step 1: Use the formula for the measure of each exterior angle in a regular polygon
Measure of each exterior angle = 360° ÷ n

Step 2: Substitute the given value and solve for n
24° = 360° ÷ n
n = 360° ÷ 24° = 15

Therefore, the regular polygon has 15 sides.

### Example 3
A farmer in the Brong-Ahafo Region wants to fence a triangular portion of his land. If two of the interior angles measure 60° and 70°, find the measure of the third interior angle.

Given:
- The land is in the shape of a triangle
- Two interior angles measure 60° and 70°

Step 1: Recall that the sum of interior angles in a triangle is 180°

Step 2: Subtract the given angles from 180° to find the measure of the third angle
Third angle = 180° - (60° + 70°) = 180° - 130° = 50°

Therefore, the third interior angle of the triangular land measures 50°.

## Practice Problems
1. Calculate the sum of interior angles in a decagon.
2. In a regular polygon, each interior angle measures 156°. How many sides does the polygon have?
3. The measures of four interior angles of a pentagon are 90°, 100°, 110°, and 120°. Find the measure of the fifth interior angle.

(Answers: 1. 1440°; 2. 12 sides; 3. 120°)
