## Introduction
Trigonometry is a crucial branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. It has numerous real-world applications, from construction and surveying to navigation and astronomy. In Ghana, trigonometry is used in various aspects of daily life. For example, farmers use trigonometric principles to calculate the slopes of their fields and optimize irrigation. Architects and engineers rely on trigonometry to design sturdy buildings and bridges that can withstand the forces of nature. Even in the bustling markets of Accra and Kumasi, traders use trigonometric ratios to calculate the heights of stacks of goods and the angles of display shelves.

As Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE examination, mastering the sine and cosine rules will not only help you excel in your exams but also provide you with valuable skills applicable to various fields. By understanding these rules, you'll be able to solve complex triangle problems and develop a strong foundation for higher-level mathematics.

## Main Content
### The Sine Rule
The sine rule is used to solve triangles when we know either:
- Two angles and one side (AAS)
- Two sides and a non-included angle (SSA)

The sine rule states that for a triangle ABC:

$\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides opposite angles $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively.

### The Cosine Rule
The cosine rule is used to solve triangles when we know:
- Three sides (SSS)
- Two sides and the included angle (SAS)

The cosine rule states that for a triangle ABC:

$a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A$
$b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \cos B$
$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$

### Choosing the Appropriate Rule
To determine which rule to use, follow these guidelines:
- If you know two angles and one side, use the sine rule (AAS)
- If you know two sides and a non-included angle, use the sine rule (SSA)
- If you know three sides, use the cosine rule (SSS)
- If you know two sides and the included angle, use the cosine rule (SAS)

### Solving Triangles Step-by-Step
To solve a triangle using the sine or cosine rule:
1. Identify the given information and the required values
2. Determine the appropriate rule based on the given information
3. Substitute the known values into the chosen rule
4. Solve the equation for the unknown value
5. Check your answer for reasonableness and accuracy

## Worked Examples
1. In triangle ABC, $a = 5$ cm, $b = 7$ cm, and $C = 60°$. Find the length of side $c$.

Since we have two sides and the included angle, we'll use the cosine rule.

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$
$c^2 = 5^2 + 7^2 - 2(5)(7) \cos 60°$
$c^2 = 25 + 49 - 70(\frac{1}{2})$
$c^2 = 39$
$c = \sqrt{39} \approx 6.24$ cm

Therefore, the length of side $c$ is approximately 6.24 cm.

2. A farmer in the Ashanti Region has a triangular plot of land. The sides of the plot measure 40 m, 50 m, and 30 m. Find the largest angle of the plot.

We have three sides, so we'll use the cosine rule. Let's find angle $C$, opposite the longest side.

$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab \cos C$
$50^2 = 40^2 + 30^2 - 2(40)(30) \cos C$
$2500 = 1600 + 900 - 2400 \cos C$
$2400 \cos C = 2500 - 2500 = 0$
$\cos C = 0$
$C = \arccos(0) = 90°$

The largest angle of the plot is 90°.

3. In a gold mining pit, the angle of elevation from point A to the top of the pit (point B) is 30°. The distance from A to the bottom of the pit (point C) is 100 meters. Find the depth of the pit (distance from B to C).

[IMAGE: Triangle ABC with angle A = 30°, side AC = 100 m, and side BC labeled as "depth"]

We have one side and a non-included angle, so we'll use the sine rule.

$\frac{BC}{\sin 30°} = \frac{100}{\sin 90°}$
$BC = \frac{100 \sin 30°}{\sin 90°} = 100 (\frac{1}{2}) = 50$ meters

The depth of the mining pit is 50 meters.

## Practice Problems
1. In triangle PQR, $p = 6$ cm, $q = 8$ cm, and $R = 45°$. Find the length of side $r$.
2. A telecommunications tower casts a shadow of 30 meters when the angle of elevation from the end of the shadow to the top of the tower is 60°. Find the height of the tower.
3. In a right-angled triangle XYZ, $x = 4$ cm, $y = 3$ cm, and angle $Z = 90°$. Find the length of side $z$.

(Answers: 1. $r \approx 6.63$ cm; 2. Height $\approx 51.96$ m; 3. $z = 5$ cm)
