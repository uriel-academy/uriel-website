## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
1. Identify and categorize household resources for sustainable living
2. Apply the 3 R's (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) to conserve household resources 
3. Create a household budget to manage financial resources responsibly
4. Implement energy and water conservation techniques in the home
5. Repurpose waste materials into useful household items

## Introduction
Sustainable living is crucial for every Ghanaian household. By managing our resources wisely, we can save money, protect the environment, and build a better future for our families and communities. Imagine Ama, a young entrepreneur who sells waakye at the local market. By conserving water and using biodegradable packaging, she reduces her costs and attracts environmentally-conscious customers. Or consider Kwame, a carpenter who repurposes wood scraps into beautiful furniture, minimizing waste and creating unique products. As you learn about sustainable living, think about how you can apply these principles in your daily life and future career.

## Main Content

### Categories of Household Resources
Household resources can be classified into four main categories:
1. Natural resources (water, energy, land)
2. Financial resources (money, savings, investments)
3. Material resources (food, clothing, furniture, appliances)
4. Human resources (skills, knowledge, time, labor)

To live sustainably, we must manage each type of resource responsibly.

### The 3 R's: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
The 3 R's are a simple but powerful strategy for conserving resources:

1. **Reduce:** Minimize waste by buying only what you need and choosing products with less packaging.
2. **Reuse:** Find new uses for items instead of discarding them. For example, repurpose old clothes into cleaning rags or use glass jars for storage.
3. **Recycle:** Sort waste materials such as paper, plastic, and metal, and deliver them to recycling centers.

### Energy and Water Conservation Techniques
Conserving energy and water helps reduce household expenses and protects the environment. Here are some simple techniques:

Energy conservation:
- Turn off lights and appliances when not in use
- Use energy-efficient light bulbs (CFLs or LEDs)
- Open windows for ventilation instead of using air conditioning
- Iron clothes in bulk to save energy

Water conservation: 
- Fix leaky taps and pipes promptly
- Take shorter showers instead of baths
- Collect rainwater for watering plants
- Reuse greywater from washing dishes or laundry for flushing toilets

| Energy Conservation | Water Conservation |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Turn off lights and appliances | Fix leaky taps and pipes |
| Use energy-efficient light bulbs | Take shorter showers |
| Open windows for ventilation | Collect rainwater |
| Iron clothes in bulk | Reuse greywater |

### Household Budgeting
Managing financial resources is essential for sustainable living. Follow these steps to create a household budget:

1. Calculate your total monthly income
2. List all fixed expenses (rent, utilities, school fees)
3. Estimate variable expenses (food, transportation, entertainment)
4. Allocate funds for savings and emergencies
5. Track your spending and adjust as needed

| Income | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Salary | GHS 2,000 |
| Side hustle | GHS 500 |
| Total Income| GHS 2,500 |

| Expenses | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Rent | GHS 600 |
| Utilities | GHS 300 |
| Food | GHS 800 |
| Transportation | GHS 200 |
| Savings | GHS 400 |
| Total Expenses| GHS 2,300 |

## Practical Activity
1. Repurpose waste materials into useful household items.

Materials:
- Empty plastic bottles
- Old fabric scraps (kente, batik, or any available)
- Scissors
- Glue or needle and thread

Instructions:
1. Clean and dry the plastic bottles.
2. Cut the bottom off the bottles to create a cylindrical shape.
3. Wrap the bottle in fabric scraps, securing with glue or stitching.
4. Use the repurposed bottles as pencil holders, flower vases, or storage containers.

2. Conduct a household energy audit.

Instructions:
1. List all electrical appliances in your home.
2. Check the energy rating of each appliance (watts or kilowatt-hours).
3. Monitor how long each appliance is used daily.
4. Calculate the total energy consumption for each appliance and for your entire household.
5. Identify areas where you can reduce energy use and implement conservation techniques.

Expected outcome: Students will understand their household energy consumption and develop a plan to conserve energy and save money.

## Career Connections
Sustainable living skills are valuable in many Ghanaian careers:
- Tailors can use fabric scraps to create patchwork designs, reducing waste.
- Chefs can compost food waste and use locally-sourced ingredients.
- Carpenters can repurpose wood scraps into smaller products like toys or decorative items.
- Entrepreneurs can develop eco-friendly products or services, such as reusable shopping bags or energy-efficient appliances.
