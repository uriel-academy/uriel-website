## Introduction
Leadership is an important part of life for young Ghanaians like you. Whether at school, at your church or mosque, or in your community, there are always opportunities to develop and demonstrate leadership. Kofi, the senior prefect at a junior high school in Kumasi, has learned that good leadership is all about serving others. He tries to lead by example, helping younger students and organizing activities to make the school better. 

Ama admires the way her pastor leads with wisdom and compassion, guiding the congregation at her church in Accra. And Kwame is inspired by the humility and dedication of the imam at his family's mosque.

As class prefect, Abena looked for ways to serve her classmates. She organized after-school study groups and mentored younger students. She asked her peers for feedback and ideas.
