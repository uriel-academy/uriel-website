## Introduction
Functions and mapping are essential concepts in mathematics that have numerous applications in everyday life. In Ghana, we encounter functions in various situations, such as calculating the total cost of items bought at the market based on their individual prices or determining the amount of mobile money received based on the amount sent minus transaction fees. For farmers, understanding the relationship between the amount of fertilizer used and crop yield is crucial. As you prepare for your BECE exams, mastering functions and mapping will help you solve problems efficiently and accurately.

In this section, we will explore the concept of functions, learn how to identify and represent them, and apply this knowledge to solve real-world problems. By the end of this section, you will have a solid foundation in functions and mapping, which will help you excel in your mathematics exams and apply these skills to everyday situations.

## Main Content
### What is a Function?
A **function** is a special type of relation between two sets, where each element in the first set (called the **domain**) is mapped to a unique element in the second set (called the **codomain**). In other words, a function assigns a single output value to each input value.

The general notation for a function is:

$f: A \rightarrow B$

where $f$ is the function name, $A$ is the domain, and $B$ is the codomain.

### Determining if a Relation is a Function
To determine whether a relation is a function, we need to check if each element in the domain is mapped to a unique element in the codomain. There are several ways to represent relations:

1. Sets of ordered pairs
2. Tables
3. Graphs

For each representation, we can use the following tests to determine if the relation is a function:

1. Vertical Line Test (for graphs): If a vertical line intersects the graph at most once, then the relation is a function.
2. Unique Output Test (for sets of ordered pairs or tables): If each input value corresponds to a single output value, then the relation is a function.

### Function Notation and Evaluation
Functions can be represented using equations, where the input variable is usually denoted by $x$ and the output variable by $f(x)$ or $y$. For example, the function $f(x) = 2x + 1$ means that for each input value $x$, the output value is $2x + 1$.

To evaluate a function for a given input value, substitute the input value for the variable in the function equation and simplify. For example, given $f(x) = 2x + 1$, find $f(3)$:

$f(3) = 2(3) + 1$
$f(3) = 6 + 1$
$f(3) = 7$

Therefore, the output value of $f(x)$ when $x = 3$ is $7$.

### Types of Functions
There are various types of functions, each with its own characteristics and properties. Some common types include:

1. Linear functions
2. Quadratic functions
3. Exponential functions
4. Logarithmic functions
5. Trigonometric functions

Each type of function has a unique shape when graphed and can be represented by a specific equation form. For example, linear functions have the general form $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.

| Function Type | General Equation Form |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Linear        | $y = mx + b$         |
| Quadratic     | $y = ax^2 + bx + c$  |
| Exponential   | $y = a \cdot b^x$    |

## Worked Examples
1. Determine whether the following relation is a function:
   {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), (3, 7)}

   Solution:
   To determine if the given relation is a function, we need to check if each input value (first element of each ordered pair) corresponds to a single output value (second element of each ordered pair).

   In this case, the input value 3 is mapped to both 4 and 7, which violates the condition for a function. Therefore, the given relation is not a function.

2. Given the function $g(x) = 3x - 2$, find $g(5)$.

   Solution:
   To find $g(5)$, we substitute $x = 5$ into the function equation and simplify.

   $g(5) = 3(5) - 2$
   $g(5) = 15 - 2$
   $g(5) = 13$

   Therefore, $g(5) = 13$.

3. A farmer notices that the yield of his maize crop (in tons) is directly proportional to the amount of fertilizer used (in kilograms). If he uses 50 kg of fertilizer and gets a yield of 2 tons, find the function that relates the amount of fertilizer used to the yield. How much yield can he expect if he uses 75 kg of fertilizer?

   Solution:
   Let $x$ be the amount of fertilizer used (in kg) and $y$ be the yield (in tons). Since the yield is directly proportional to the amount of fertilizer, we can write the function as:

   $y = kx$

   where $k$ is the constant of proportionality.

   Given that 50 kg of fertilizer results in a yield of 2 tons, we can find the value of $k$:

   $2 = k(50)$
   $k = \frac{2}{50} = 0.04$

   Therefore, the function relating the amount of fertilizer used to the yield is:

   $y = 0.04x$

   To find the yield when 75 kg of fertilizer is used, substitute $x = 75$ into the function:

   $y = 0.04(75)$
   $y = 3$

   Therefore, the farmer can expect a yield of 3 tons when using 75 kg of fertilizer.

## Practice Problems
1. Determine whether the following relation is a function:
   {(2, 5), (4, 7), (6, 9), (8, 11)}

2. Given the function $h(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 1$, find $h(-2)$.

3. A mobile money company charges a 1% transaction fee for each money transfer. If Kofi sends GH₵500 to Ama, how much will Ama receive? Write a function that relates the amount sent to the amount received after the transaction fee.

Answers:
1. Yes, the relation is a function.
2. $h(-2) = 17$
3. Ama will receive GH₵495. The function is $y = 0.99x$, where $x$ is the amount sent and $y$ is the amount received.
