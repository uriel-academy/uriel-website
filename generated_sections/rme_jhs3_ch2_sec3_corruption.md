## Introduction
Kofi and Ama were walking home from school in Accra, discussing the news they heard about a government official caught in a corruption scandal. They wondered how corruption affects their lives and community, and what they could do about it. As they passed by a mosque and a church, they reflected on the religious and moral values they've been taught at school, home and their respective places of worship.
