## Introduction
Money and financial calculations are an essential part of everyday life in Ghana. Whether you're buying groceries at the market, saving money in your bank account, or preparing for your future, understanding how to work with money is a crucial skill. In this section, we'll explore the mathematics behind money and financial calculations, using examples relevant to Ghanaian students like yourself. By mastering these concepts, you'll be better equipped to manage your finances and excel in your BECE exams.

Imagine you're at the market, and you want to buy a few items for dinner. You'll need to quickly calculate the total cost and ensure you have enough cash on hand. Or perhaps you're helping your parents with their mobile money transactions, and you need to determine the amount of interest they'll earn on their savings. These real-life scenarios demonstrate the importance of understanding money and financial calculations in your daily life as a Ghanaian student.

## Main Content
### Converting between Ghana Cedis and Pesewas
The **Ghana Cedi (GH₵)** is the official currency of Ghana, and it is divided into 100 **Pesewas (p)**. To convert from Ghana Cedis to Pesewas, multiply the amount in Ghana Cedis by 100:

Pesewas = Ghana Cedis × 100

For example, if you have GH₵5.50, you can convert it to Pesewas like this:
5.50 × 100 = 550p

To convert from Pesewas to Ghana Cedis, divide the amount in Pesewas by 100:

Ghana Cedis = Pesewas ÷ 100

For example, if you have 750p, you can convert it to Ghana Cedis like this:
750 ÷ 100 = GH₵7.50

### Calculating Discounts and Sales Prices
When shops offer discounts, you can calculate the sale price using the following formula:

Sale Price = Original Price - Discount

The discount is usually given as a percentage of the original price. To calculate the discount amount, use this formula:

Discount = Original Price × Discount Percentage

For example, if a shirt originally costs GH₵50 and is on sale for 20% off, you can calculate the discount and sale price like this:
Discount = 50 × 0.20 = GH₵10
Sale Price = 50 - 10 = GH₵40

### Simple Interest on Savings
When you save money in a bank account or invest in a fixed deposit, you can earn interest on your savings. Simple interest is calculated using the following formula:

Interest = Principal × Interest Rate × Time (in years)

- **Principal** is the initial amount of money you save or invest.
- **Interest Rate** is the percentage of the principal that you earn as interest, usually expressed as a decimal.
- **Time** is the duration you save or invest the money, measured in years.

For example, if you save GH₵1000 in a bank account with a 5% annual interest rate for 3 years, you can calculate the interest you'll earn like this:
Interest = 1000 × 0.05 × 3 = GH₵150

| Simple Interest Formula |
|--------------------------|
| I = P × R × T |

where:
- I = Interest
- P = Principal
- R = Interest Rate (as a decimal)
- T = Time (in years)

### Solving Real-World Problems
To solve real-world problems involving money and financial calculations, follow these steps:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the question being asked.
2. Determine the appropriate formula or method to use based on the problem type (e.g., converting currency, calculating discounts, or finding simple interest).
3. Substitute the given values into the formula and perform the necessary calculations.
4. Double-check your work and ensure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

## Worked Examples
1. Kofi wants to buy a book that costs GH₵15.75. How much will he pay in Pesewas?

   Solution:
   To convert GH₵15.75 to Pesewas, multiply by 100:
   15.75 × 100 = 1,575p
   Therefore, Kofi will pay 1,575 Pesewas for the book.

2. Adwoa sees a dress on sale for 30% off its original price of GH₵80. What is the sale price of the dress?

   Solution:
   First, calculate the discount amount:
   Discount = 80 × 0.30 = GH₵24
   
   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:
   Sale Price = 80 - 24 = GH₵56
   Therefore, the sale price of the dress is GH₵56.

3. Kwame saves GH₵500 in a bank account that offers a 4% annual interest rate. How much interest will he earn after 5 years?

   [IMAGE: A timeline showing the principal amount of GH₵500 and the 5-year duration, with arrows indicating the simple interest calculation.]

   Solution:
   Use the simple interest formula:
   Interest = Principal × Interest Rate × Time
            = 500 × 0.04 × 5
            = GH₵100
   Therefore, Kwame will earn GH₵100 in interest after 5 years.
