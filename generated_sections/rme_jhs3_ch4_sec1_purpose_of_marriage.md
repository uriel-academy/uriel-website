## Introduction
Marriage is an essential part of Ghanaian society, serving as the foundation for building strong families and communities. In our diverse nation, where Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African Religion coexist, the purpose of marriage remains the same: to create a loving, supportive, and stable environment for couples to grow together and raise their children. Whether you live in the bustling streets of Accra, the historical city of Kumasi, or a small village, understanding the purpose of marriage is crucial for your personal growth and the development of our society.

Imagine Kofi and Ama, a young couple who met at church in Accra. They have decided to get married and start their life together. As they embark on this journey, they must understand the responsibilities and challenges that come with marriage. Similarly, Kwame and Abena, who met at a mosque in Kumasi, are also preparing for their wedding. They, too, must be aware of the purpose of marriage and the roles they will play as husband and wife.
