3. Understand the concept of lunar and solar eclipses.
4. Discuss the effects of the Moon on Earth, including tides.

## Introduction
The Earth and Moon are celestial bodies that have fascinated humans for centuries. In Ghana, we experience the Earth's diverse landscapes, from the lush forests in the south to the savanna regions in the north. The Volta River, which flows through Ghana, is a vital source of water for agriculture, such as cocoa farming, and generates electricity at the Akosombo Dam. The Moon, visible in the night sky, has influenced our culture and traditions. Understanding the Earth and Moon is essential for appreciating our planet and its relationship with its natural satellite.

## Main Content
### Structure and Composition of the Earth
The Earth is composed of three main layers: the **crust**, **mantle**, and **core**. The crust is the outermost layer, which we live on, and it is made up of solid rocks. In Ghana, the crust is rich in minerals such as gold, bauxite, and diamonds. The mantle is the middle layer, made up of hot, dense rocks. The core is the innermost layer, divided into the liquid outer core and the solid inner core, composed mainly of iron and nickel.

### The Moon's Surface and Phases
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. Its surface is covered with craters, mountains, and plains called **maria**. The Moon's appearance changes throughout the month due to its phases. The phases occur as the Moon orbits the Earth, and the amount of sunlight reflecting off its surface varies. The main phases are:

1. New Moon
2. Waxing Crescent
3. First Quarter
4. Waxing Gibbous
5. Full Moon
6. Waning Gibbous
7. Last Quarter
8. Waning Crescent

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| New Moon | The Moon is between the Earth and the Sun, so the unlit side faces Earth. |
| Waxing Crescent | A thin crescent of the Moon becomes visible on the right side. |
| First Quarter | The right half of the Moon is visible. |
| Waxing Gibbous | More than half of the Moon's lit surface is visible, growing each day. |
| Full Moon | The entire lit surface of the Moon is visible from Earth. |
| Waning Gibbous | More than half of the Moon's lit surface is visible, shrinking each day. |
| Last Quarter | The left half of the Moon is visible. |
| Waning Crescent | A thin crescent of the Moon is visible on the left side. |

### Lunar and Solar Eclipses
Eclipses occur when the Earth, Moon, and Sun align in a straight line. A **lunar eclipse** happens when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the Moon. A **solar eclipse** occurs when the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun's light from reaching Earth.

### Effects of the Moon on Earth
The Moon influences the Earth in several ways, most notably through tides. Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and, to a lesser extent, the Sun. The tidal range varies depending on the location and the alignment of the Earth, Moon, and Sun.

**Practical Example: Observing the Moon's Phases**
Materials:
- A notebook
- A pencil
- A clear view of the Moon

Procedure:
1. For one month, observe the Moon each night at the same time.
2. In your notebook, sketch the shape of the Moon and note the date.
3. Compare your sketches at the end of the month and identify the phases you observed.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculating the distance between the Earth and the Moon:
   - The average distance between the Earth and the Moon is 384,400 km.
   - In scientific notation, this can be written as 3.844 × 10^5 km.

2. Determining the tidal range:
   - During a spring tide, the high tide level is 3.2 m, and the low tide level is 0.8 m.
   - Tidal range = High tide level - Low tide level
   - Tidal range = 3.2 m - 0.8 m = 2.4 m

## Summary
- The Earth is composed of the crust, mantle, and core.
- The Moon's surface features include craters, mountains, and plains called maria.
- The Moon has eight main phases: New Moon, Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, Last Quarter, and Waning Crescent.
- Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon, while solar eclipses occur when the Moon blocks the Sun's light from reaching Earth.
- The Moon influences Earth's tides through its gravitational pull.
