## Introduction
Energy changes in chemical reactions play a crucial role in our daily lives and in many industries across Ghana. From the warmth we feel when we light a fire to cook our favorite Ghanaian dishes to the energy generated at the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River, chemical reactions involving energy changes are all around us. Understanding these processes can help us appreciate the science behind the foods we eat, the fuels we use, and the natural phenomena we observe in our tropical climate. In this chapter, we will explore the fascinating world of energy changes in chemical reactions and their significance in our lives as Ghanaian students.

## Main Content

### Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions
Chemical reactions can be classified based on the energy changes that occur during the reaction. **Exothermic reactions** release energy to the surroundings, usually in the form of heat or light. A common example is the combustion of fuels, such as charcoal or firewood, which we use for cooking in many Ghanaian households. The heat released during these reactions warms our food and our homes.

On the other hand, **endothermic reactions** absorb energy from the surroundings, usually in the form of heat. A simple example is the dissolving of ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃) in water, which is used in instant cold packs for treating injuries. As the ammonium nitrate dissolves, it absorbs heat from the water, causing the solution to become cold.

### Activation Energy
For a chemical reaction to occur, the reactants must overcome an energy barrier known as the **activation energy**. This is the minimum energy required for the reactants to collide with the proper orientation and sufficient energy to break existing bonds and form new ones. **Catalysts** are substances that lower the activation energy of a reaction, allowing it to occur more easily and quickly without being consumed in the process.

In Ghana, the use of catalysts is crucial in the production of important industrial chemicals like ammonia (NH₃), which is used to make fertilizers for our cocoa farms and other crops. The Haber-Bosch process, which combines nitrogen (N₂) from the air with hydrogen (H₂) to produce ammonia, uses an iron catalyst to speed up the reaction.

### Energy Changes in Everyday Life and Industries
Energy changes in chemical reactions have numerous applications in our daily lives and industries in Ghana. Some examples include:

- Combustion of fuels for cooking, transportation, and electricity generation
- Respiration, which is an exothermic reaction that provides energy for our bodies
- Photosynthesis, an endothermic reaction in plants that converts sunlight into chemical energy
- Production of important chemicals like ammonia, sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) used in various industries

Practical Experiment: Exothermic Reaction with Baking Soda and Vinegar
You can observe an exothermic reaction using common household materials:

1. Place a small amount of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO₃) in a plastic cup.
2. Carefully pour vinegar (acetic acid, CH₃COOH) into the cup containing baking soda.
3. Touch the outside of the cup and observe the temperature change.
4. Record your observations.

The reaction between baking soda and vinegar produces carbon dioxide gas (CO₂), water (H₂O), and sodium acetate (CH₃COONa). The heat released during this exothermic reaction causes the cup to feel warm.

## Worked Examples

1. Calculating the energy change in a reaction:
In a combustion reaction, 5 moles of methane (CH₄) react with excess oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water, releasing 2,220 kJ of energy. Calculate the energy released per mole of methane.

Solution:
Energy released per mole of methane = Total energy released ÷ Number of moles of methane
= 2,220 kJ ÷ 5 mol
= 444 kJ/mol

Therefore, the combustion of one mole of methane releases 444 kJ of energy.

2. Determining the type of reaction based on temperature change:
During a reaction between two substances, A and B, the temperature of the mixture decreases from 25°C to 18°C. Is this an exothermic or endothermic reaction?

Solution:
Since the temperature decreases during the reaction, the reaction absorbs energy from the surroundings, causing the surroundings to cool down. Therefore, this is an endothermic reaction.

## Summary
- Exothermic reactions release energy to the surroundings, while endothermic reactions absorb energy from the surroundings.
- Activation energy is the minimum energy required for a reaction to occur, and catalysts lower the activation energy without being consumed in the reaction.
- Energy changes in reactions are important in everyday life and industries, such as in cooking, respiration, photosynthesis, and the production of chemicals like ammonia.
- The type of reaction (exothermic or endothermic) can be determined by observing temperature changes during the reaction.
- Practical experiments, like the reaction between baking soda and vinegar, can help demonstrate exothermic reactions using common materials.
