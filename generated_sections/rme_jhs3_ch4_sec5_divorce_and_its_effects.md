## Introduction
Kofi and Ama, both JHS 3 students from Kumasi, have been noticing an increasing number of their classmates coming from divorced families. They have seen how divorce can affect their friends emotionally and academically. As they walk past the local mosque and church on their way to school, they wonder what their religions teach about divorce and how they can support their friends during this challenging time.

Divorce is a reality in Ghana's multi-religious society, and it is essential for students to understand its causes, effects, and how to cope with it. In this section, we will explore the concept of divorce, its impact on families and society, and the religious perspectives on the issue.

### Religious Perspectives on Divorce
Ghana's major religions have different views on divorce:

| Religion | Perspective on Divorce |
|----------|------------------------|
| Christianity | Generally discourages divorce, but some denominations allow it under certain circumstances (e.g., adultery, abandonment) |
| Islam | Allows divorce as a last resort after attempts at reconciliation have failed |
| Traditional African Religion | Views divorce as a disruption of the family and community harmony, but allows it if the marriage is causing harm or suffering |

### Coping with Divorce
Divorce can be emotionally challenging for everyone involved, especially children. Some ways to cope with divorce include:
- Seeking support from family, friends, or professionals (e.g., counselors, religious leaders)
- Focusing on personal growth and self-care
- Maintaining a positive relationship with both parents (for children)
- Participating in support groups or activities

## Examples
1. Abena, a JHS 3 student from Accra, was struggling to concentrate in class after her parents divorced. Her teacher noticed her change in behavior and referred her to the school counselor, who helped Abena process her emotions and develop coping strategies.
