## Learning Objectives

1. Identify the major organs of the respiratory system and their functions.

3. Explain the role of the respiratory system in gas exchange and cellular respiration.
4. Discuss common respiratory diseases prevalent in Ghana and their prevention.

## Introduction
The respiratory system is a vital component of the human body, responsible for the exchange of gases between the atmosphere and our cells. In Ghana, where cocoa farming is a major agricultural activity, farmers rely on their respiratory system to provide the necessary oxygen for the physical labor required in the fields. Additionally, the humid tropical climate in Ghana can sometimes lead to respiratory issues, making it crucial for students to understand the functioning and care of this essential body system.

Just as the Akosombo Dam harnesses the power of the Volta River to generate electricity for Ghana, our respiratory system works tirelessly to ensure that our cells receive the oxygen they need to produce energy. By learning about the respiratory system, students will gain a deeper appreciation for the complex processes that keep our bodies functioning optimally.

## Main Content
### Organs of the Respiratory System
The main organs of the respiratory system include:
1. **Nose and nasal cavity**: These structures filter, warm, and humidify the incoming air.
2. **Pharynx**: Also known as the throat, the pharynx is a passageway for both air and food.
3. **Larynx**: The larynx, or voice box, contains the vocal cords and helps regulate the flow of air into the trachea.
4. **Trachea**: The trachea, or windpipe, is a tube that carries air from the larynx to the bronchi.
5. **Bronchi and bronchioles**: These are the branching tubes that carry air from the trachea to the lungs.
6. **Lungs**: The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system, where gas exchange occurs between the air and the blood.

### The Process of Breathing
Breathing involves two main processes: inhalation and exhalation.
- **Inhalation**: When we inhale, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, increasing the volume of the chest cavity. This decrease in pressure allows air to flow into the lungs.
- **Exhalation**: During exhalation, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, decreasing the volume of the chest cavity. This increase in pressure forces air out of the lungs.

### Gas Exchange and Cellular Respiration
The primary function of the respiratory system is to facilitate gas exchange between the air and the blood. This process occurs in the **alveoli**, tiny air sacs in the lungs. Oxygen from the air diffuses into the blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the air.

The oxygen-rich blood then travels to the cells, where it is used in the process of **cellular respiration**. During this process, glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) combines with oxygen (O₂) to produce energy (ATP), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and water (H₂O). The chemical equation for cellular respiration is:

C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (ATP)

### Respiratory Diseases in Ghana
In Ghana, some common respiratory diseases include:
1. **Pneumonia**: An infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Pneumonia is a leading cause of death among children under five in Ghana.
2. **Tuberculosis (TB)**: A bacterial infection that primarily affects the lungs. Ghana has a high burden of TB, with an estimated incidence rate of 148 per 100,000 population in 2019.
3. **Asthma**: A chronic condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Asthma can be triggered by factors such as dust, smoke, and pollution.

To prevent respiratory diseases, it is essential to:
- Practice good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
- Avoid exposure to air pollution, tobacco smoke, and other irritants.
- Ensure proper ventilation in homes and workplaces.
- Seek medical attention for persistent respiratory symptoms.

#### Practical Example: Measuring Lung Capacity
Students can measure their lung capacity using a simple setup with local materials:
1. Fill a large basin or bucket with water.
2. Take a deep breath and exhale completely into a balloon.
3. Submerge the balloon in the water and measure the volume of water displaced (1 ml of water displaced = 1 ml of lung capacity).
4. Record the results and compare with classmates.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the number of oxygen molecules consumed during cellular respiration if 1 mole of glucose is completely oxidized.

Given:
- 1 mole of glucose is oxidized
- The chemical equation for cellular respiration is: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Energy (ATP)

Step 1: Determine the molar ratio of glucose to oxygen from the balanced equation.
1 mole of glucose : 6 moles of oxygen

Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of oxygen consumed.
1 mole of glucose × (6 moles of oxygen / 1 mole of glucose) = 6 moles of oxygen

Step 3: Convert moles of oxygen to molecules using Avogadro's constant (6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mole).
6 moles of oxygen × (6.022 × 10²³ molecules/mole) = 3.613 × 10²⁴ molecules of oxygen

Therefore, 3.613 × 10²⁴ molecules of oxygen are consumed when 1 mole of glucose is completely oxidized during cellular respiration.

2. A student has a lung capacity of 2,500 ml. If the average breath volume is 500 ml, calculate the number of breaths needed to completely exchange the air in the lungs.

Given:
- Lung capacity = 2,500 ml
- Average breath volume = 500 ml

Step 1: Divide the lung capacity by the average breath volume.
Number of breaths = Lung capacity ÷ Average breath volume
Number of breaths = 2,500 ml ÷ 500 ml = 5

Therefore, it would take 5 breaths to completely exchange the air in the lungs.

## Summary
- The main organs of the respiratory system are the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs.
- Breathing involves inhalation (air flows into the lungs) and exhalation (air flows out of the lungs).
- Gas exchange occurs in the alveoli, where oxygen diffuses into the blood and carbon dioxide diffuses out.
- Cellular respiration uses oxygen to convert glucose into energy, carbon dioxide, and water.
- Common respiratory diseases in Ghana include pneumonia, tuberculosis, and asthma.
- Prevention of respiratory diseases involves good hygiene, avoiding air pollution, ensuring proper ventilation, and seeking medical attention when necessary.
- Lung capacity can be measured using a simple setup with a balloon and water displacement.
