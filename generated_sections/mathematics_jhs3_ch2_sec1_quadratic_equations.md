## Introduction
Quadratic equations play a vital role in many aspects of our daily lives in Ghana. For example, when calculating the trajectory of a football kicked by a player during a match, quadratic equations help determine the ball's path. In agriculture, farmers can use quadratic equations to optimize crop yields by determining the ideal amount of fertilizer needed based on the field's size. Moreover, understanding quadratic equations is crucial for success in the BECE and WAEC exams, as they are fundamental concepts in the mathematics curriculum.

In this section, we will explore the world of quadratic equations, learning how to identify, solve, and apply them to real-life situations. By mastering these skills, you will be well-equipped to tackle problems not only in your mathematics exams but also in your daily life as a Ghanaian student.

## Main Content

### Understanding Quadratic Equations
A **quadratic equation** is an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers, and $a ≠ 0$. The highest power of the variable $x$ is 2, which is why these equations are called "quadratic."

### Methods for Solving Quadratic Equations
There are three main methods for solving quadratic equations:
1. Factoring
2. Completing the square
3. Quadratic formula

#### Factoring
To solve a quadratic equation by factoring, follow these steps:
1. Rearrange the equation in standard form: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
2. Find two numbers whose sum is $b$ and product is $ac$
3. Rewrite the equation as a product of two binomials: $(px + q)(rx + s) = 0$
4. Apply the zero product property: if $AB = 0$, then either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$ (or both)
5. Solve the resulting linear equations

#### Completing the Square
To solve a quadratic equation by completing the square, follow these steps:
1. Rearrange the equation in standard form: $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
2. Divide both sides by $a$ to make the coefficient of $x^2$ equal to 1
3. Move the constant term to the right side of the equation
4. Complete the square on the left side by adding the square of half the coefficient of $x$
5. Factor the left side as a perfect square trinomial
6. Solve the resulting equation by taking the square root of both sides

#### Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula is a direct way to solve any quadratic equation. For an equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the quadratic formula states:

$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the coefficients of the equation, and the symbol $\pm$ indicates that there are two solutions: one with a plus sign and one with a minus sign.

### Nature of Roots
The **discriminant** of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$. The discriminant determines the nature of the roots:

| Discriminant        | Nature of Roots                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|
| $\Delta > 0$        | Two distinct real roots               |
| $\Delta = 0$        | One real root (repeated)              |
| $\Delta < 0$        | No real roots (two complex conjugates)|

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Factoring
Solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0$ by factoring.

Step 1: The equation is already in standard form.
Step 2: Find two numbers whose sum is $-7$ and product is $12$. These numbers are $-3$ and $-4$.
Step 3: Rewrite the equation as a product of two binomials: $(x - 3)(x - 4) = 0$
Step 4: Apply the zero product property:
- $x - 3 = 0$ or $x - 4 = 0$
- $x = 3$ or $x = 4$

Therefore, the solutions are $x = 3$ and $x = 4$.

### Example 2: Completing the Square
Solve the quadratic equation $2x^2 - 12x + 7 = 0$ by completing the square.

Step 1: The equation is already in standard form.
Step 2: Divide both sides by $2$: $x^2 - 6x + \frac{7}{2} = 0$
Step 3: Move the constant term to the right side: $x^2 - 6x = -\frac{7}{2}$
Step 4: Add the square of half the coefficient of $x$ to both sides: $x^2 - 6x + 9 = -\frac{7}{2} + 9$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 6x + 9 = \frac{11}{2}$
Step 5: Factor the left side as a perfect square trinomial: $(x - 3)^2 = \frac{11}{2}$
Step 6: Solve the resulting equation by taking the square root of both sides:
- $x - 3 = \pm \sqrt{\frac{11}{2}}$
- $x = 3 \pm \sqrt{\frac{11}{2}}$

Therefore, the solutions are $x = 3 + \sqrt{\frac{11}{2}}$ and $x = 3 - \sqrt{\frac{11}{2}}$.

### Example 3: Quadratic Formula
Solve the quadratic equation $3x^2 + 4x - 2 = 0$ using the quadratic formula.

Given: $a = 3$, $b = 4$, $c = -2$

Using the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(3)(-2)}}{2(3)}$
$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 24}}{6}$
$x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{40}}{6}$
$x = \frac{-4 \pm 2\sqrt{10}}{6}$

Therefore, the solutions are $x = \frac{-2 + \sqrt{10}}{3}$ and $x = \frac{-2 - \sqrt{10}}{3}$.

## Practice Problems
1. Solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + 5x - 14 = 0$ by factoring.
2. Solve the quadratic equation $x^2 - 8x + 3 = 0$ by completing the square.
3. Solve the quadratic equation $2x^2 - 7x - 15 = 0$ using the quadratic formula.

(Answers: 1. $x = -7$ or $x = 2$; 2. $x = 4 \pm \sqrt{13}$; 3. $x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{109}}{4}$)

## Summary
- Quadratic equations are of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are real numbers, and $a ≠ 0$
- Three main methods for solving quadratic equations: factoring, completing the square, and quadratic formula
- The discriminant $\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$ determines the nature of the roots
- If $\Delta > 0$, there are two distinct real roots; if $\Delta = 0$, there is one repeated real root; if $\Delta < 0$, there are no real roots (two complex conjugates)
