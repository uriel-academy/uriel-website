## Practical Activity
### Repairing a Torn Seam
Materials:
- Needle
- Thread (matching the fabric color)
- Scissors

Instructions:
1. Cut a length of thread about 18 inches long and thread the needle, doubling the thread and tying a knot at the end.
2. Turn the garment inside out to access the torn seam.
3. Starting about 1/2 inch before the tear, insert the needle into the fabric and begin sewing using a simple running stitch.
4. Continue sewing along the seam, keeping stitches small and even, until you reach about 1/2 inch past the end of the tear.
5. Tie off the thread with a secure knot and trim any excess.
6. Turn the garment right side out and press the seam flat with an iron if available.

Expected Outcome:
The torn seam should be repaired, and the garment should be wearable again without the tear being noticeable.
