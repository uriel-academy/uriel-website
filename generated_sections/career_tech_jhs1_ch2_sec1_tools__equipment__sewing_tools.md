## Introduction
Sewing is an essential life skill that allows us to make and repair our own clothing. In Ghana, many people earn a living through sewing, from the skilled seamstresses at the market to the tailors creating bespoke kente cloth garments. Even if you don't become a professional, knowing how to sew can help you mend torn clothes, sew on missing buttons, take up a hem, and make simple items like pillowcases or bags. 

Learning to sew also teaches valuable skills like precision, measuring, and attention to detail that are useful in many careers. For example, carpenters use measuring skills to cut wood accurately, while cooks measure ingredients precisely. Sewing helps develop your fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination. Let's get started learning some basic sewing skills that will serve you well throughout your life!

### Sewing Tools
To start sewing, you'll need some basic tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 1. Needles | For hand sewing. Choose according to thickness of fabric. |  
| 2. Thread | Holds fabric together. Match color to fabric. Cotton or polyester. |
| 3. Fabric scissors | For cutting fabric. Must be sharp! Keep separate from paper scissors. |
| 4. Measuring tape | Flexible tape marked with centimeters for measuring fabric. |
| 5. Pins | Temporarily holds fabric pieces together before sewing. |
| 6. Pin cushion | Safely stores pins and needles. Can make from scrap fabric stuffed with batting. |

### Threading a Needle
1. Cut a piece of thread about 50cm long. 
2. Wet the end of the thread with saliva and roll between your fingers to flatten it.
3. Hold the needle up to the light. Squint one eye to see the eye more clearly.
4. Push the thread through the eye of the needle. 
5. Pull the thread through until the ends line up evenly.
6. Tie the two thread ends together in a knot.

### Basic Stitches
Two of the most useful hand stitches are the running stitch and backstitch:

**Running Stitch:**
1. Push threaded needle in and out of the fabric at even intervals. 
2. Keep stitches small and uniform in size.
3. Knot off the thread on the back side when finished sewing the seam.

**Backstitch:** 
1. Make one running stitch forward.
2. Insert needle at the end of previous stitch and bring it out one stitch length ahead.  
3. Continue stitching one step back and one step forward.
4. Produces a strong, secure seam. Ideal for repairing holes or tears.

### Measuring and Cutting Fabric
Accurate measuring and cutting is essential for sewing projects to fit properly.

1. Lay fabric on a flat surface. Use weights or pins to hold it in place if needed.
2. Measure carefully with measuring tape. Mark measurements with chalk or washable fabric marker. 
3. Cut fabric with sharp fabric scissors, following the marked lines precisely.

| Safety Rules for Fabric Scissors |
|----------------------------------|
| 1. Keep fingers away from blades while cutting. |
| 2. Always close scissors when not actively using them. |  
| 3. Store safely out of reach of small children. |
| 4. Use scissors ONLY for cutting fabric - no paper, plastic, etc. |

### Sewing on a Button

1. Thread your needle and knot the end. 
2. Position the button on the fabric where you want it. 
3. Push threaded needle up from the underside of the fabric and through one buttonhole.
4. Insert needle down through the opposite buttonhole and the fabric. 
5. Repeat steps 3-4 several times until the button is securely attached. 
6. On the final stitch, wrap the thread around the base of the button a few times to create a shank. This allows space for the buttonhole.
7. Push needle through to the underside and knot off the thread.

## Practical Activity
### Make a Simple Drawstring Bag
#### Materials:
- Two rectangles of fabric 25cm x 35cm (old bedsheet or curtain is fine)
- 1 meter of narrow cord or ribbon for drawstring 
- Needle and thread
- Fabric scissors
- Measuring tape
- Pins

#### Instructions:
1. Measure and cut out two fabric rectangles 25cm wide by 35cm long.
2. Place the rectangles together with right sides facing. Pin in place.
3. Using a running stitch and 1cm seam allowance, sew along both long sides and one short side. 
4. Turn the bag right side out. Fold and press the open edge down by 1cm, then fold over again by 3cm to create a channel for the drawstring. Pin in place.
5. Sew along the edge of the drawstring channel with a running stitch, keeping the channel open at both ends.
6. Attach a safety pin to one end of your cord or ribbon. Feed it through the drawstring channel.  
7. Tie the ends of the drawstring together. Turn the bag inside out to hide the seams.

#### Expected Outcome: 
Students will create a simple lined drawstring bag that can be used for storing small items or as a gift bag. They will practice measuring, cutting, and sewing straight seams.
