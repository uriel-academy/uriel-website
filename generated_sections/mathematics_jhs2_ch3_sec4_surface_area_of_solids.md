## Learning Objectives
After completing this section, students will be able to:
1. Identify and differentiate between prisms, cylinders, pyramids, cones, and spheres
2. Calculate the surface area of prisms and cylinders using appropriate formulas
3. Determine the surface area of pyramids and cones using the given formulas
4. Find the surface area of spheres and hemispheres using the surface area formula

## Introduction
In our daily lives, we encounter various objects that resemble geometric solids. For instance, when you visit the market in Accra, you might see cylindrical tins of milk, pyramidal packages of spices, or spherical oranges. As a student preparing for the BECE exams, understanding how to calculate the surface area of these solids is crucial. Surface area is the total area of all the faces of a solid object. In this section, we will learn how to find the surface area of prisms, cylinders, pyramids, cones, and spheres, enabling you to solve real-life problems involving these shapes.

Imagine you are a farmer in the Eastern Region of Ghana, and you need to paint the exterior of a cylindrical silo that stores your cocoa beans. Knowing how to calculate the surface area of the silo will help you determine the amount of paint needed for the job. Similarly, if you are designing a packaging box for your family's business in Kumasi, understanding the surface area of prisms will be essential. By mastering these concepts, you will be well-prepared for the WAEC/BECE exams and equipped to tackle everyday mathematical challenges in Ghana.

## Main Content

### Prisms and Cylinders
A **prism** is a 3D shape with two identical ends (called bases) and flat sides. The sides are rectangles. Examples include cubes, cuboids, and triangular prisms. A **cylinder** is similar to a prism but has circular bases and a curved lateral surface.

The surface area of a prism or cylinder is the sum of the areas of all its faces:

[IMAGE: Diagrams of a prism and cylinder with labeled dimensions]

Surface Area of Prism = 2 × Area of Base + Area of Lateral Faces
* For a cuboid with length l, width w, and height h: 
$SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)$

Surface Area of Cylinder = 2 × Area of Base + Area of Curved Surface
* For a cylinder with radius r and height h:
$SA = 2πr^2 + 2πrh$

| Shape    | Surface Area Formula                    |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Cube     | $SA = 6a^2$ (where a = edge length)     |
| Cuboid   | $SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)$                  |
| Cylinder | $SA = 2πr^2 + 2πrh$                     |

### Pyramids and Cones
A **pyramid** is a 3D shape with a polygon base and triangular lateral faces that meet at a point (apex). A **cone** is similar but has a circular base and a curved lateral surface.

[IMAGE: Diagrams of a pyramid and cone with labeled dimensions]

Surface Area of Pyramid = Area of Base + Area of Lateral Faces
* For a square pyramid with base edge a and slant height l: 
$SA = a^2 + 2al$

Surface Area of Cone = Area of Base + Area of Curved Surface
* For a cone with radius r and slant height s:
$SA = πr^2 + πrs$

### Spheres and Hemispheres
A **sphere** is a 3D shape where every point on the surface is the same distance from the center. A **hemisphere** is half a sphere.

[IMAGE: Diagram of a sphere with labeled radius]

Surface Area of Sphere = $4πr^2$
Surface Area of Hemisphere = $2πr^2$

## Worked Examples

1. Calculate the surface area of a cuboid with length 5 cm, width 3 cm, and height 4 cm.

[IMAGE: Cuboid with dimensions 5 cm × 3 cm × 4 cm]

Using the formula for surface area of a cuboid:
$SA = 2(lw + lh + wh)$
$SA = 2(5 × 3 + 5 × 4 + 3 × 4)$
$SA = 2(15 + 20 + 12)$
$SA = 2(47)$
$SA = 94 \text{ cm}^2$

2. A cylindrical water tank has a diameter of 2.8 meters and a height of 4.5 meters. Find its surface area. (Take π = 3.14)

[IMAGE: Cylinder with diameter 2.8 m and height 4.5 m]

Radius = Diameter ÷ 2 = 2.8 ÷ 2 = 1.4 m

Using the formula for surface area of a cylinder:
$SA = 2πr^2 + 2πrh$
$SA = 2 × 3.14 × (1.4)^2 + 2 × 3.14 × 1.4 × 4.5$
$SA = 12.32 + 39.56$
$SA = 51.88 \text{ m}^2$

3. A square pyramid has a base edge of 6 cm and a slant height of 5 cm. Calculate its surface area.

[IMAGE: Square pyramid with base edge 6 cm and slant height 5 cm]

Using the formula for surface area of a square pyramid:
$SA = a^2 + 2al$
$SA = 6^2 + 2 × 6 × 5$
$SA = 36 + 60$
$SA = 96 \text{ cm}^2$

## Practice Problems
1. A cube has a surface area of 294 cm². Find the length of its edge.
2. Calculate the surface area of a cone with a radius of 3.5 cm and a slant height of 6 cm. (Take π = 3.14)
3. A sphere has a radius of 10 cm. Determine its surface area. (Take π = 3.14)

**Answers:**
1. 7 cm
2. 103.81 cm²
3. 1256 cm²
