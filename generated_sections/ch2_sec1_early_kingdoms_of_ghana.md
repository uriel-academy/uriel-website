Before the formation of the modern nation of Ghana, the region was home to several powerful kingdoms. These early kingdoms emerged around the 6th century CE and were known for their wealth, military might, and advanced social structures. The most notable among these was the Kingdom of Ghana, which reached its peak between the 9th and 11th centuries CE.

### The Kingdom of Ghana
The Kingdom of Ghana, also known as Wagadou, was a powerful West African empire that existed from approximately 300 CE to 1240 CE. It was located in the savanna region of present-day southeastern Mauritania and western Mali. The kingdom was renowned for its wealth, derived primarily from the trade of gold and salt.

The Kingdom of Ghana was ruled by a powerful king known as the **Ghana**, who was both the political and spiritual leader of the empire. The Ghana was assisted by a council of ministers and provincial governors who helped in the administration of the vast kingdom.

### Social and Economic Structures
The social structure of the Kingdom of Ghana was hierarchical, with the Ghana at the top, followed by the nobility, skilled artisans, and farmers. The kingdom was divided into provinces, each governed by a provincial ruler appointed by the Ghana.

| Social Class | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| The Ghana    | The supreme ruler of the kingdom, both politically and spiritually |
| Nobility     | Wealthy and influential individuals who assisted in governing the kingdom |
| Artisans     | Skilled craftsmen who produced valuable goods, such as gold jewelry and textiles |
| Farmers      | The majority of the population, responsible for agricultural production |

The economy of the Kingdom of Ghana was based on agriculture, gold mining, and trade. The kingdom's strategic location along the trans-Saharan trade routes allowed it to control the gold trade between West Africa and the Mediterranean world. This trade brought great wealth and prosperity to the kingdom.

### The Decline of the Kingdom of Ghana
Despite its power and influence, the Kingdom of Ghana began to decline in the 11th century CE due to several factors:

1. The rise of rival states, such as the **Almoravid Empire**, which conquered the Kingdom of Ghana in 1076 CE
2. Overexploitation of gold mines, leading to a decrease in gold production and trade
3. Climate change, resulting in drought and famine, which weakened the kingdom's agricultural base
4. Internal political instability and power struggles within the ruling class

By the 13th century CE, the Kingdom of Ghana had fragmented into smaller states, paving the way for the rise of new empires, such as the Mali Empire.

## Examples

1. The Great Mosque of Kumasi, built in the 18th century, is an example of the Islamic influence on Ghanaian architecture during the time of the early kingdoms. The mosque's design incorporates elements of traditional Ghanaian architecture, such as the use of local materials and the incorporation of open courtyards.

2. The Ashanti Kingdom, which rose to prominence in the 17th century, can be seen as a continuation of the legacy of the early Ghanaian kingdoms. The Ashanti Kingdom was known for its military prowess, wealth derived from the gold trade, and the powerful Ashanti kings who ruled the empire.
