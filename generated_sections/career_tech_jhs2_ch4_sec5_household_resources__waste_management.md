## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify the different types of household waste and their sources
2. Sort waste into different categories for proper disposal
3. Create a compost bin using locally available materials
4. Implement waste reduction strategies in their homes and communities

## Introduction
Waste management is an essential skill for every Ghanaian household. From the bustling markets of Accra to the small villages in the countryside, proper waste management helps keep our communities clean, healthy, and safe. Imagine a successful restaurant owner in Kumasi who maintains a spotless kitchen and dining area, or a tailor in Cape Coast who keeps their workspace organized and free of fabric scraps. By learning effective waste management techniques, you can develop habits that will serve you well in your future careers and contribute to a cleaner environment for all Ghanaians.

## Main Content
### Types of Household Waste
Household waste can be classified into four main categories:
1. **Organic waste**: Food scraps, yard trimmings, and other biodegradable materials
2. **Recyclable waste**: Paper, plastic, glass, and metal that can be processed and reused
3. **Hazardous waste**: Batteries, electronics, cleaning products, and other items that contain harmful chemicals
4. **General waste**: Non-recyclable and non-hazardous items, such as plastic bags and broken ceramics

### Sorting Waste for Disposal
To ensure proper disposal, it is essential to sort waste into different categories. Follow these steps to set up a waste sorting system in your home:
1. Obtain three or four containers (bins, buckets, or bags) for each waste category
2. Label each container clearly with the waste category: Organic, Recyclable, Hazardous, and General
3. Place the containers in a convenient location, such as the kitchen or yard
4. Educate family members on the importance of sorting waste and how to use the containers properly

### Composting Organic Waste
Composting is an eco-friendly way to manage organic waste and create nutrient-rich soil for gardens. To create a compost bin, follow these steps:
1. Choose a location in your yard that is easily accessible and away from direct sunlight
2. Obtain a large container, such as a wooden crate or plastic bin with holes drilled for aeration
3. Layer organic materials in the container, alternating between green (food scraps, fresh grass clippings) and brown (dry leaves, paper, straw) materials
4. Keep the compost moist but not soggy, and mix the contents every few weeks to promote decomposition

### Waste Reduction Strategies
Reducing waste at the source is the most effective way to manage household waste. Some strategies include:
- Using reusable shopping bags instead of plastic bags
- Buying products with minimal packaging
- Repairing or repurposing items instead of discarding them
- Donating unwanted items in good condition to charity organizations

| Waste Category | Disposal Method |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Organic        | Composting      |
| Recyclable     | Recycling centers or collection services |
| Hazardous      | Designated hazardous waste collection points |
| General        | Municipal waste collection services |

## Practical Activity
1. Create a mini compost bin
   - Materials: a large plastic container (10-20 liters), drill, organic waste (food scraps, dry leaves, paper)
   - Instructions:
     1. Drill holes in the sides and bottom of the container for aeration
     2. Layer organic materials, alternating between green and brown materials
     3. Keep the compost moist and mix the contents every few weeks
     4. After 2-3 months, the compost should be ready for use in your garden
   - Expected outcome: nutrient-rich compost for gardening

2. Conduct a waste audit
   - Materials: waste bins, gloves, scale, notebook and pen
   - Instructions:
     1. Over a week, collect and sort household waste into the four categories
     2. Weigh each category and record the data in your notebook
     3. Analyze the data to identify areas where waste can be reduced
     4. Implement waste reduction strategies based on your findings
   - Expected outcome: increased awareness of household waste generation and targeted waste reduction strategies

## Career Connections
Effective waste management skills are valuable in many Ghanaian careers, such as:
- Restaurant owners and chefs who need to maintain clean and hygienic kitchens
- Tailors and dressmakers who must manage fabric waste and keep their workspaces organized
- Entrepreneurs who develop eco-friendly products or services, such as compost or recycled crafts
- Environmental officers who oversee waste management in cities and towns

## Summary
- Household waste can be classified into organic, recyclable, hazardous, and general categories
- Proper waste sorting ensures effective disposal and recycling
- Composting is an eco-friendly way to manage organic waste and create nutrient-rich soil
- Waste reduction strategies include using reusable items, minimizing packaging, and donating unwanted items
- Effective waste management skills are valuable in many Ghanaian careers
