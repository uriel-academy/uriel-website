### Kente Cloth: A Symbol of Ghanaian Pride
Kente cloth is a renowned Ghanaian textile known for its vibrant colors and intricate patterns. Originating from the Ashanti region, Kente cloth is hand-woven using a combination of silk and cotton threads. Each pattern and color holds symbolic meaning, often representing proverbs, historical events, or social status.

The weaving process involves:
1. Preparing the threads
2. Setting up the loom
3. Weaving the cloth strip by strip
4. Stitching the strips together to create the final Kente cloth
