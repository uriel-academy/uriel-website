## Introduction
Probability is a crucial concept in mathematics that helps us understand the likelihood of events occurring in our daily lives. From deciding whether to carry an umbrella based on the chance of rain to calculating the odds of winning a game of ampe, probability is all around us. In Ghana, understanding probability is essential for making informed decisions in various aspects of life, such as managing finances, planning agricultural activities, and even preparing for the BECE exams. By mastering the concepts of simple probability, students can develop critical thinking skills and apply mathematical reasoning to real-world situations.

Imagine you are selling fruits at the market, and you have a basket containing 20 oranges, 15 bananas, and 10 mangoes. If a customer randomly selects a fruit from the basket, what is the probability that they will choose a banana? By applying the principles of simple probability, you can quickly determine the likelihood of this event occurring. This knowledge can help you make better decisions in your daily life and prepare you for success in your academic journey, especially as you approach the BECE exams.

## Main Content
### Basic Principles of Probability
Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event is impossible, and 1 means the event is certain to happen. The probability of an event A is denoted as P(A).

### Calculating Simple Probability
To calculate the probability of a simple event, we use the following formula:

P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes)/(Total number of possible outcomes)

For example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, the probability of getting a 4 is:

P(rolling a 4) = (Number of ways to get a 4)/(Total number of possible outcomes) = 1/6

### Complement Rule
The complement of an event A, denoted as A', is the event that occurs when A does not occur. The probability of the complement of an event A is given by:

P(A') = 1 - P(A)

For instance, if the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of 52 cards is 1/2, then the probability of not drawing a red card (i.e., drawing a black card) is:

P(not drawing a red card) = 1 - P(drawing a red card) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2

### Applying Simple Probability to Real-Life Situations
Simple probability can be applied to various real-life situations in Ghana. For example, let's consider a farmer who has a herd of 50 cattle, consisting of 30 cows and 20 bulls. If the farmer randomly selects one animal to sell at the market, what is the probability that the selected animal is a cow?

[IMAGE: A diagram showing a herd of cattle with 30 cows and 20 bulls]

To solve this problem, we can use the simple probability formula:

P(selecting a cow) = (Number of cows)/(Total number of cattle) = 30/50 = 3/5

Therefore, the probability of selecting a cow from the herd is 3/5 or 60%.

## Worked Examples
1. In a bag containing 12 balls, there are 4 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 3 green balls. If a ball is randomly drawn from the bag, what is the probability that it is blue?

Solution:
Total number of balls = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12
Number of blue balls = 5
P(drawing a blue ball) = (Number of blue balls)/(Total number of balls) = 5/12

2. A spinner has 8 equal sections, numbered 1 to 8. If the spinner is spun once, what is the probability of getting an even number?

[IMAGE: A diagram of a spinner with 8 equal sections, numbered 1 to 8]

Solution:
Total number of possible outcomes = 8
Number of favorable outcomes (even numbers) = 4 (2, 4, 6, 8)
P(getting an even number) = (Number of even numbers)/(Total number of possible outcomes) = 4/8 = 1/2

3. In a class of 30 students, 18 are girls, and 12 are boys. If a student is randomly selected to answer a question, what is the probability that the student is a boy?

Solution:
Total number of students = 18 + 12 = 30
Number of boys = 12
P(selecting a boy) = (Number of boys)/(Total number of students) = 12/30 = 2/5

## Practice Problems
1. A die is rolled once. What is the probability of getting a number less than 4?
2. In a basket of 20 fruits, there are 8 apples, 7 oranges, and 5 pears. If a fruit is randomly selected, what is the probability that it is not an apple?
3. A card is drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards. What is the probability of drawing a heart?

(Answers: 1. 1/2; 2. 3/5; 3. 1/4)

## Summary
- Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
- The probability of a simple event A is calculated using the formula: P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes)/(Total number of possible outcomes).
- The complement of an event A, denoted as A', is the event that occurs when A does not occur. The probability of the complement is given by: P(A') = 1 - P(A).
- Simple probability can be applied to various real-life situations, such as farming, market transactions, and games.
- When solving simple probability problems, it is essential to identify the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.
