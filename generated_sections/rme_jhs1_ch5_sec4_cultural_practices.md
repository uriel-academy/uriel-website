### Respecting Diversity in Cultural Practices
While there are many common cultural practices in Ghana, it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of practices among different religious groups. For example:

- Christians may celebrate Christmas and Easter, while Muslims observe Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha.
