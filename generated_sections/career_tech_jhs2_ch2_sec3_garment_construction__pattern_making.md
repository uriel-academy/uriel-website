## Introduction
Pattern making is an essential skill for anyone interested in sewing and clothing construction. In Ghana, there are many opportunities to use this skill, whether you want to become a professional tailor, start your own fashion business, or simply make clothes for yourself and your family. Imagine being able to create perfectly fitting garments for any occasion, from traditional kente cloth dresses for festivals to stylish everyday wear.

Many successful Ghanaian entrepreneurs have built their businesses on the foundation of pattern making and sewing skills. For example, Joyce Ababio, founder of Joyce Ababio College of Creative Design, started her career as a seamstress and went on to become one of Ghana's most celebrated fashion designers. By learning the basics of pattern making, you too can take the first steps towards a rewarding career in the fashion industry.

## Main Content
### Tools and Materials for Pattern Making
To get started with pattern making, you will need the following tools and materials:

| Tools | Materials |
|-------|-----------|
| Tape measure | Pattern paper or cardboard |
| Ruler or yardstick | Pencil and eraser |
| French curve | Scissors |
| Tracing wheel | Fabric for testing patterns |
| Notcher | |

### Taking Body Measurements
Accurate body measurements are crucial for creating well-fitting patterns. Here are the key measurements you'll need:

1. **Bust**: Measure around the fullest part of the bust, keeping the tape measure parallel to the floor.
2. **Waist**: Measure around the natural waistline, where the body bends slightly.
3. **Hip**: Measure around the fullest part of the hips, about 20cm below the waist.
4. **Back length**: Measure from the base of the neck to the waistline.

### Drafting a Simple Bodice Block Pattern
A bodice block is a basic pattern that serves as a starting point for creating various garment designs. Follow these steps to draft a simple bodice block:

1. On your pattern paper, draw a vertical line equal to the back length measurement.
2. Draw horizontal lines at the bust, waist, and hip levels, based on your measurements.
3. Use your French curve to connect these lines, creating the shape of the bodice.
4. Add darts to provide shaping at the bust and waist.

### Adding Seam Allowances and Notches
Once you have drafted your basic pattern, you need to add seam allowances and notches:

- **Seam allowances** are extra space added around the edges of the pattern to allow for sewing the garment together. A standard seam allowance is 1.5cm.
- **Notches** are small marks on the pattern that help align the pieces during sewing. Place notches at key points like the center front, center back, and sleeve edges.

## Practical Activity
Now that you've learned the basics of pattern making, let's put your skills into practice by creating a simple top pattern.

Materials needed:
- Pattern paper or cardboard
- Pencil and eraser
- Ruler or yardstick
- French curve
- Scissors
- 1 meter of plain cotton fabric

Instructions:
1. Take your body measurements (bust, waist, hip, back length) and record them.
2. Draft a bodice block pattern based on your measurements, following the steps outlined in the main content.
3. Add seam allowances and notches to your pattern.
4. Cut out your pattern pieces from the paper or cardboard.
5. Test your pattern by cutting the shapes from your cotton fabric and sewing them together to create a simple top.

Expected outcome:
By the end of this activity, you should have a basic top pattern that fits your measurements and a completed sample top made from cotton fabric.
