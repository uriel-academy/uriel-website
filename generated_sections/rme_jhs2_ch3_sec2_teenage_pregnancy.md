## Introduction
Kofi and Ama, both JHS 2 students in Kumasi, have noticed that some of their classmates are missing school more often. They overhear their friends talking about a girl who dropped out because she got pregnant. Kofi and Ama are concerned and wonder how they can avoid finding themselves in a similar situation. They decide to pay close attention in their RME class, where their teacher, Mr. Mensah, is about to discuss the topic of teenage pregnancy and its moral implications in Ghana's multi-religious society.

Ghana's diverse religious landscape, with Christians, Muslims, and followers of Traditional African Religion, provides a rich foundation for moral guidance. All these faiths emphasize the importance of moral values, character development, and living responsibly. As young people navigate the challenges of adolescence, religious and moral education plays a crucial role in guiding them towards making informed decisions that align with their faith and contribute positively to society.

## Main Content
### Causes of Teenage Pregnancy
Several factors contribute to the high rates of teenage pregnancy in Ghana:
- Lack of comprehensive sex education
- Peer pressure to engage in sexual activity
- Poverty and lack of access to contraception
- Inadequate parental guidance and support

### Religious and Moral Teachings on Sexual Behavior
Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African Religion all promote **abstinence** and **chastity** before marriage. They teach that sex is a sacred act meant to be enjoyed within the context of marriage.

- Christianity: "Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body." (1 Corinthians 6:18)
- Islam: "And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and is evil as a way." (Quran 17:32)
- Traditional African Religion: Emphasizes the importance of **moral character** and **responsibility** to oneself, family, and community

### Consequences of Teenage Pregnancy
Teenage pregnancy can have severe consequences for both the young mother and her child:

| Consequence | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Dropping out of school | Limited education and fewer opportunities |
| Health risks | Complications during pregnancy and childbirth |
| Financial strain | Difficulty providing for the child's needs |
| Social stigma | Isolation and discrimination from the community |

### Prevention and Support
To prevent teenage pregnancy and support those affected by it, consider the following:
1. Seek guidance from trusted adults, such as parents, teachers, or religious leaders
2. Focus on education and set clear goals for the future
3. Participate in youth programs that promote abstinence and responsible decision-making
4. Access healthcare services and contraception if sexually active
5. Seek support from organizations that assist teenage mothers and their children

## Examples
1. Abena, a 15-year-old girl from Accra, was pressured by her boyfriend to have sex. She remembered the teachings from her church's youth group about the importance of abstinence and resisted the pressure, focusing instead on her education and future goals.

2. Kwame, a 16-year-old boy from a small village, learned that his classmate had gotten pregnant. He reached out to his imam for guidance on how to avoid a similar situation and learned about the Islamic teachings on chastity and the importance of waiting until marriage.
