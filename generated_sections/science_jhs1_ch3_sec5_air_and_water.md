## Introduction
Air and water are essential for life on Earth. In Ghana, we rely on these resources for various activities, from breathing to farming. Cocoa farming, a significant part of Ghana's economy, depends on the availability of clean air and water. The Akosombo Dam on the Volta River generates hydroelectric power for the country, highlighting the importance of water resources. However, air and water pollution pose significant threats to our health and the environment. Understanding the properties and composition of air and water, as well as the causes and effects of pollution, is crucial for protecting these valuable resources.

## Main Content
### Composition and Properties of Air
Air is a mixture of gases that surrounds us. The main components of air are **nitrogen** (N₂) at 78% and **oxygen** (O₂) at 21%. The remaining 1% consists of other gases such as **carbon dioxide** (CO₂), **water vapor** (H₂O), and trace amounts of **noble gases** like argon (Ar) and neon (Ne).

| Gas         | Percentage |
|-------------|------------|
| Nitrogen    | 78%        |
| Oxygen      | 21%        |
| Other gases | 1%         |

Air has several properties, including:
- It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless
- It has mass and exerts pressure
- It is compressible and expandable

### The Water Cycle
The water cycle, also known as the **hydrologic cycle**, is the continuous movement of water on Earth. In Ghana, the water cycle plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of water resources. The main stages of the water cycle are:

1. Evaporation: Heat from the sun causes water to change from a liquid to a gas. In Ghana, evaporation occurs from water bodies like the Volta River, Lake Volta, and the Atlantic Ocean.

2. Condensation: As water vapor rises and cools, it condenses back into liquid water, forming clouds. The tropical climate of Ghana favors the formation of clouds and precipitation.

3. Precipitation: Water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. In Ghana, rainfall is the primary form of precipitation, with two rainy seasons in the south and one in the north.

### Sources and Effects of Air and Water Pollution
Air and water pollution are major environmental concerns in Ghana. Some sources of pollution include:
- Vehicle emissions
- Industrial activities (e.g., mining, oil and gas extraction)
- Agricultural practices (e.g., pesticide and fertilizer use)
- Improper waste disposal

The effects of air and water pollution are far-reaching:
- Health problems: Respiratory issues, waterborne diseases (e.g., cholera, typhoid)
- Environmental damage: Acid rain, climate change, harm to aquatic life
- Economic impact: Reduced agricultural productivity, increased healthcare costs

### Preventing and Controlling Pollution
To protect our air and water resources, we can take the following actions:
- Reduce, reuse, and recycle waste
- Promote clean energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydroelectric)
- Enforce regulations on industrial emissions and waste disposal
- Educate the public about the importance of environmental conservation
- Plant trees and create green spaces to absorb pollutants

Practical Example: Create a simple air filter using local materials
1. Gather materials: a plastic bottle, scissors, cotton wool, and activated charcoal
2. Cut the bottom of the plastic bottle and make small holes in the cap
3. Fill the bottle with layers of cotton wool and activated charcoal
4. Attach the cap and place the filter over a source of air pollution (e.g., a burning candle)
5. Observe the difference in the appearance of the cotton wool before and after filtration

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the percentage of oxygen in a 500 mL sample of air.
   - Total volume of air = 500 mL
   - Oxygen content in air = 21%
   - Volume of oxygen = 21% × 500 mL = 0.21 × 500 mL = 105 mL
   Therefore, the volume of oxygen in a 500 mL sample of air is 105 mL.

2. If 200 mL of water evaporates from a total of 1000 mL of water in a container, what percentage of the water has evaporated?
   - Initial volume of water = 1000 mL
   - Volume of water evaporated = 200 mL
   - Percentage of water evaporated = (Volume of water evaporated ÷ Initial volume of water) × 100
   - Percentage of water evaporated = (200 mL ÷ 1000 mL) × 100 = 0.2 × 100 = 20%
   Therefore, 20% of the water has evaporated.

## Summary
- Air is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%).
- The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation, and is essential for maintaining water resources in Ghana.
- Air and water pollution have significant health, environmental, and economic consequences.
- Pollution can be prevented and controlled through waste reduction, clean energy, regulations, education, and environmental conservation efforts.
- Practical experiments, such as creating a simple air filter, can demonstrate the effects of pollution and the importance of taking action.
