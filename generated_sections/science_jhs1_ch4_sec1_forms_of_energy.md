## Introduction
Energy is all around us and is essential for life on Earth. It powers our homes, fuels our vehicles, and even enables our bodies to function. In Ghana, we harness energy in many ways - from the hydroelectric power generated at the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River to the chemical energy stored in the food crops like cassava and cocoa that farmers grow. Understanding the different forms of energy and how they can be converted from one form to another is crucial for developing sustainable energy solutions for Ghana's future.

In this section, we will explore the main forms of energy, the principle of energy conservation, and see how energy transformations occur in practical examples from everyday life in Ghana. By the end, you will have a solid foundation in the science of energy that will enable you to tackle energy-related issues facing our country.

## Main Content

### Forms of Energy
Energy exists in several forms, but they can all be classified into two main categories: 
1. **Kinetic energy** - energy of motion
2. **Potential energy** - stored energy due to an object's position or configuration

Some common forms of energy include:
- **Mechanical energy**: Sum of an object's kinetic and potential energy 
- **Chemical energy**: Energy stored in chemical bonds, e.g. in food, fuel, batteries
- **Electrical energy**: Energy of electric charges, e.g. in power lines, electrical appliances
- **Thermal energy**: Energy of the random motion of particles in a substance
- **Radiant energy**: Energy of electromagnetic waves, e.g. sunlight, radio waves
- **Nuclear energy**: Energy stored in the nucleus of atoms, released in nuclear reactions

### Energy Conversion
Energy can be converted from one form to another. Some everyday examples of energy conversion in Ghana include:
- A solar panel converts radiant energy from the sun into electrical energy
- A hydroelectric turbine at Akosombo Dam converts the mechanical energy of falling water into electrical energy
- A car engine converts the chemical energy in gasoline into mechanical energy to move the car
- A stove converts the chemical energy in firewood or gas into thermal energy to cook food

### Conservation of Energy
The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. The total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant.

Practical experiment: Demonstrating energy conversion and conservation
Materials:
- Plastic bottle
- Water
- Scissors
- Small hole punch
Procedure:
1. Use scissors to cut the plastic bottle in half 
2. Punch holes around the bottom edge of the top half of the bottle
3. Fill the bottom half with water
4. Hold the top half above the water, with holes facing down
5. Observe the water flowing through the holes and falling into the bottom half
The gravitational potential energy of the water is converted into kinetic energy as it falls, then into mechanical energy as it strikes the water in the bottom, where its energy is dissipated as thermal energy and sound. The total energy at the start and end is the same, demonstrating conservation of energy.

### Energy Efficiency
While energy is conserved, not all of it ends up in the desired form during energy conversions. The ratio of useful energy output to total energy input is called **energy efficiency**. Improving energy efficiency is key for sustainable development. Some strategies include:
- Using energy-saving appliances and lights (LED bulbs)
- Proper maintenance of vehicles and generators
- Insulating buildings to reduce thermal energy loss
- Adopting renewable energy sources like solar that have lower conversion losses

## Worked Examples

1. Calculating kinetic energy
A 1000 kg car is travelling at 20 m/s. Calculate its kinetic energy.
KE = 0.5 × m × v^2
   = 0.5 × 1000 kg × (20 m/s)^2
   = 200,000 J = 200 kJ

2. Calculating gravitational potential energy  
A 50 kg sack of cocoa beans is lifted 2 m off the ground. Calculate the change in its gravitational potential energy. (Take g = 10 m/s^2) 
PE = m × g × h
   = 50 kg × 10 m/s^2 × 2 m
   = 1000 J = 1 kJ

3. Efficiency of an electric motor
An electric motor converts 8000 J of electrical energy into 7000 J of mechanical energy. Calculate its efficiency.
Efficiency = (Useful energy output ÷ Total energy input) × 100%
        = (7000 J ÷ 8000 J) × 100% 
        = 0.875 × 100% = 87.5%
