By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify at least 3 major global issues facing our world today
2. Explain the perspectives of Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African Religion on responding to global challenges
3. Describe how religious values can inspire actions to address global problems

## Introduction
Kofi and Ama were walking home from school in Accra, discussing what they learned in RME class about global issues like poverty, conflict, and climate change. They wondered how their religious values could guide them in responding to these big challenges. 

At church that weekend, their pastor spoke about how Christians are called to love their neighbors and care for creation. Kofi realized that includes neighbors around the world suffering from global problems. Similarly, when Ama visited her grandparents in Kumasi, her grandfather shared Akan proverbs about living in harmony with nature and being a force for good in the world.

As students in Ghana's diverse religious society, Kofi, Ama and their classmates have an exciting opportunity to explore how different religious traditions offer moral wisdom for addressing the global issues confronting their generation. By learning from each other and working together guided by shared values like compassion, peace, and stewardship, they can make a positive difference.

- **Poverty and hunger:** Millions of people worldwide lack access to basic necessities

- **Climate change and environmental degradation:** Human activities are harming the planet
- **Inequality and injustice:** Some groups face discrimination and lack equal rights and opportunities

### Religious Perspectives on Responding to Global Issues
The major religious traditions in Ghana all emphasize moral responsibility to address human suffering and care for the environment. For example:

| Religion | Teaching on Responding to Global Issues |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| Christianity | Love your neighbor, care for the poor and vulnerable, be good stewards of creation |  
| Islam | Show compassion, give charity, practice moderation to protect nature |
| Traditional African Religion | Live in harmony with nature, use resources wisely, strengthen the community |

These teachings provide a foundation for religious communities to respond to global challenges through:
1. Raising awareness and educating members
2. Providing aid and services to people in need 
3. Advocating for policies to address root causes
4. Mobilizing members to take action in their daily lives

### Applying Religious Values to Make a Difference  
Religious values can inspire and empower individuals to be part of the solution to global problems. For instance:
- Motivated by their faith, a group of **Muslim youth** in Accra organized a neighborhood clean-up and tree-planting project to care for the environment. 
- A **Christian women's fellowship** collected donations to support education for girls in a refugee camp, promoting justice and equality.
- During the fasting month of Ramadan, an **interfaith group** of Muslims and Christians volunteered together at a homeless shelter, putting compassion into practice.

Students can reflect on their own religious and moral values to identify ways they can contribute, such as:
- Volunteering for a cause they care about
- Raising funds or collecting donations for trustworthy aid organizations
- Educating their peers and families about global issues and inspiring action
- Praying for world leaders to have wisdom, and for people affected by global challenges

Even small actions, when guided by religious values and multiplied by many people, can make a meaningful difference.

## Examples
Here are two examples of how Ghanaians have put religious values into practice to address global issues:

1. In Cape Coast, a **Traditional African priest** learned that nearby illegal mining was polluting the rivers and harming the community's health. Guided by traditional teachings on respecting nature, he brought together community leaders to speak out against the mining and organized a protest that got the attention of local officials. As a result, the mining was halted and the river could begin to heal.

2. A **teenage girl in Tamale** was inspired by learning about Islamic teachings on charity and compassion for the poor. She started a small business selling handmade jewelry and decided to donate a portion of her profits to a local orphanage. Her example encouraged her classmates to find ways to give back too, multiplying the impact.

These examples show how religious and moral values can guide people of all ages and backgrounds to take action and make a positive difference in the world.
