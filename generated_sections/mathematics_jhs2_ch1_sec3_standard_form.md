# Chapter 1: Numbers and Operations
## Section: Standard Form

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of standard form (scientific notation) for representing very large or very small numbers
2. Convert numbers from standard form to ordinary numbers and vice versa
3. Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with numbers in standard form
4. Apply standard form to solve real-life problems involving very large or very small quantities

### Introduction
In our daily lives, we often encounter very large or very small numbers. For example, when buying goods at the market, you might deal with large amounts of money, such as GH₵1,000,000 for a wholesale purchase. On the other hand, when measuring the weight of small items like spices or seeds, you might work with very small quantities like 0.00001 kg. In science and technology, we also use very large and small numbers to express distances in space, sizes of atoms, or the speed of light. To make these numbers easier to work with, we use a concise representation called standard form or scientific notation. Learning standard form will help you in your BECE exams and future studies, as well as in practical applications like calculating profits in business or understanding scientific concepts.

### Main Content
#### What is Standard Form?
**Standard form**, also known as **scientific notation**, is a way of writing very large or very small numbers in a concise and easily readable format. In standard form, a number is expressed as a product of a number between 1 and 10 (called the **coefficient**) and a power of 10 (called the **base**).

The general format of a number in standard form is:

$a \times 10^n$

where:
- $a$ is the coefficient, a number between 1 and 10
- $10$ is the base
- $n$ is an integer (positive, negative, or zero)

For example, the number 1,000,000 can be written in standard form as $1 \times 10^6$, and 0.00001 can be written as $1 \times 10^{-5}$.

#### Converting Numbers to Standard Form
To convert a number to standard form, follow these steps:
1. Move the decimal point to the right or left until you have a number between 1 and 10 (the coefficient).
2. Count the number of places you moved the decimal point. This will be the power of 10 (the exponent).
   - If you moved the decimal point to the left, the exponent will be positive.
   - If you moved the decimal point to the right, the exponent will be negative.
3. Write the number as a product of the coefficient and the power of 10.

For example, to convert 123,456 to standard form:
1. Move the decimal point 5 places to the left: 1.23456
2. The exponent is positive 5: $10^5$
3. The number in standard form is: $1.23456 \times 10^5$

To convert 0.0078 to standard form:
1. Move the decimal point 3 places to the right: 7.8
2. The exponent is negative 3: $10^{-3}$
3. The number in standard form is: $7.8 \times 10^{-3}$

#### Converting Numbers from Standard Form
To convert a number from standard form to an ordinary number, simply reverse the process:
1. If the exponent is positive, move the decimal point to the right by the number of places indicated by the exponent.
2. If the exponent is negative, move the decimal point to the left by the number of places indicated by the exponent.

For example, to convert $4.2 \times 10^3$ to an ordinary number:
1. The exponent is positive 3, so move the decimal point 3 places to the right: 4200

To convert $5.6 \times 10^{-2}$ to an ordinary number:
1. The exponent is negative 2, so move the decimal point 2 places to the left: 0.056

#### Arithmetic Operations with Standard Form
When performing arithmetic operations with numbers in standard form, follow these rules:

| Operation | Rule | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Addition and Subtraction | Convert numbers to the same power of 10, then add or subtract coefficients | $3 \times 10^4 + 2 \times 10^4 = (3 + 2) \times 10^4 = 5 \times 10^4$ |
| Multiplication | Multiply coefficients and add exponents | $(2 \times 10^3) \times (4 \times 10^5) = (2 \times 4) \times 10^{3+5} = 8 \times 10^8$ |
| Division | Divide coefficients and subtract exponents | $(6 \times 10^7) \div (2 \times 10^4) = (6 \div 2) \times 10^{7-4} = 3 \times 10^3$ |

### Worked Examples
1. The distance from Earth to the Sun is approximately 150,000,000 km. Express this distance in standard form.

   [IMAGE: Diagram showing the Earth and Sun with the distance between them labeled]

   Solution:
   - Move the decimal point 8 places to the left: 1.5
   - The exponent is positive 8: $10^8$
   - The distance in standard form is: $1.5 \times 10^8$ km

2. A farmer has 0.0025 kg of tomato seeds. Express this weight in standard form.

   Solution:
   - Move the decimal point 3 places to the right: 2.5
   - The exponent is negative 3: $10^{-3}$
   - The weight in standard form is: $2.5 \times 10^{-3}$ kg

3. Calculate the product of $2 \times 10^4$ and $3 \times 10^{-2}$.

   Solution:
   - Multiply the coefficients: $2 \times 3 = 6$
   - Add the exponents: $4 + (-2) = 2$
   - The result is: $6 \times 10^2 = 600$

4. A company's annual profit increased from $5 \times 10^6$ GH₵ to $8 \times 10^6$ GH₵. Calculate the increase in profit.

   Solution:
   - The numbers have the same exponent, so we can subtract the coefficients: $8 - 5 = 3$
   - The increase in profit is: $3 \times 10^6$ GH₵ or 3,000,000 GH₵

### Practice Problems
1. Convert 56,789,000 to standard form.
2. Convert $9.1 \times 10^{-4}$ to an ordinary number.
3. Simplify $(4 \times 10^5) \times (2 \times 10^{-3})$.
4. A factory produces $1.2 \times 10^4$ units per day. How many units does it produce in a week (7 days)?

(Answers: 1. $5.6789 \times 10^7$; 2. 0.00091; 3. $8 \times 10^2$ or 800; 4. $8.4 \times 10^4$ or 84,000 units)

### Summary
- Standard form is a concise way to represent very large or very small numbers as a product of a coefficient (1 to 10) and a power of 10.
- To convert a number to standard form, move the decimal point until you have a number between 1 and 10, then count the number of places moved to determine the exponent.
- To convert a number from standard form, move the decimal point according to the exponent (right for positive, left for negative).
- When adding or subtracting numbers in standard form, convert them to the same power of 10, then add or subtract the coefficients.
- When multiplying numbers in standard form, multiply the coefficients and add the exponents.
- When dividing numbers in standard form, divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents.
