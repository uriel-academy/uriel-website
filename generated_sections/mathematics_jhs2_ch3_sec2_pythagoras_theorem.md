## Introduction
The Pythagoras theorem is a fundamental concept in mathematics that has numerous applications in our daily lives. In Ghana, we encounter right-angled triangles in various situations, such as calculating the height of a tree or the diagonal distance across a farm plot. Mastering the Pythagoras theorem is essential for success in the BECE mathematics exam, as it frequently appears in questions related to geometry and mensuration.

Imagine you are helping your family at the market, and you need to calculate the shortest distance from one corner of the market to the opposite corner. By understanding and applying the Pythagoras theorem, you can easily determine this distance and save time navigating through the crowded market stalls. Similarly, when dealing with mobile money transactions or currency conversions, the Pythagoras theorem can help you make accurate calculations involving right-angled triangles.

## Main Content
### The Pythagoras Theorem
The Pythagoras theorem states that in a **right-angled triangle**, the square of the length of the **hypotenuse** (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (called the **adjacent** and **opposite** sides).

Mathematically, the theorem can be expressed as:

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the adjacent and opposite sides, respectively, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.

### Applying the Pythagoras Theorem
To find the missing side in a right-angled triangle using the Pythagoras theorem, follow these steps:
1. Identify the hypotenuse and the other two sides
2. Substitute the known values into the Pythagoras theorem equation
3. Simplify the equation and solve for the missing side

For example, if the adjacent side ($a$) is 3 cm and the hypotenuse ($c$) is 5 cm, we can find the opposite side ($b$) using:

$3^2 + b^2 = 5^2$
$9 + b^2 = 25$
$b^2 = 16$
$b = 4$ cm

### Common Pythagorean Triples
Certain sets of numbers, called **Pythagorean triples**, always satisfy the Pythagoras theorem. Some common Pythagorean triples are:

| a   | b   | c   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 3   | 4   | 5   |
| 5   | 12  | 13  |
| 8   | 15  | 17  |
| 7   | 24  | 25  |

Memorizing these triples can help you quickly solve problems involving right-angled triangles.

### Determining Right-Angled Triangles
To check if a triangle is right-angled given its side lengths, follow these steps:
1. Square each side length
2. Add the squares of the two shorter sides
3. Compare the sum with the square of the longest side
4. If the sum equals the square of the longest side, the triangle is right-angled

## Worked Examples
1. A ladder leans against a wall, forming a right angle with the ground. The ladder is 6 m long, and the base of the ladder is 2 m away from the wall. How high up the wall does the ladder reach?

[IMAGE: A ladder leaning against a wall, forming a right-angled triangle]

Let the height of the ladder on the wall be $h$.
Using the Pythagoras theorem: $2^2 + h^2 = 6^2$
$4 + h^2 = 36$
$h^2 = 32$
$h = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$ m

Therefore, the ladder reaches a height of $4\sqrt{2}$ m up the wall.

2. Kofi wants to calculate the diagonal distance across his rectangular farm plot. The plot measures 60 m by 80 m. How long is the diagonal distance?

[IMAGE: A rectangular farm plot with sides labeled 60 m and 80 m, and the diagonal marked as d]

Let the diagonal distance be $d$.
Using the Pythagoras theorem: $60^2 + 80^2 = d^2$
$3600 + 6400 = d^2$
$10000 = d^2$
$d = \sqrt{10000} = 100$ m

The diagonal distance across Kofi's farm plot is 100 m.

3. Ama is designing a logo for her small business. The logo consists of a right-angled triangle with a base of 9 cm and a hypotenuse of 15 cm. What is the height of the triangle?

Let the height of the triangle be $h$.
Using the Pythagoras theorem: $9^2 + h^2 = 15^2$
$81 + h^2 = 225$
$h^2 = 144$
$h = 12$ cm

The height of the triangle in Ama's logo is 12 cm.

## Practice Problems
1. A television screen has a diagonal measurement of 55 inches and a width of 48 inches. Calculate the height of the screen.

2. A ship sails 12 km due north and then 16 km due east. How far is the ship from its starting point?

3. In a game of billiards, the cue ball is 0.6 m from the left side of the table and 1.2 m from the bottom side. The table is 2 m long. How far is the cue ball from the top right pocket?

Answers:
1. 27 inches
2. 20 km
3. 1.6 m
