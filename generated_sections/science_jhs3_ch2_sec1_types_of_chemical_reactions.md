2. Write balanced chemical equations for each type of reaction.
3. Predict the products of chemical reactions based on the reactants.
4. Recognize examples of chemical reactions in everyday life in Ghana.

## Introduction
Chemical reactions are all around us, from the cooking of our favorite Ghanaian dishes like fufu and banku to the production of cocoa on our farms. Even the treatment of diseases like malaria and typhoid fever involves chemical reactions between medicines and pathogens in our bodies. Understanding the types of chemical reactions is essential for making sense of the world and solving problems in agriculture, health, and industry. In this section, we will explore the four main types of chemical reactions and see how they apply to our lives in Ghana.

## Main Content
### Synthesis Reactions
In a **synthesis reaction**, two or more **reactants** combine to form a single **product**. The general equation for a synthesis reaction is:

A + B → AB

An example of a synthesis reaction in Ghana is the formation of **limestone** (calcium carbonate) from calcium oxide and carbon dioxide:

CaO(s) + CO2(g) → CaCO3(s)

Limestone is an important raw material for making cement, which is used in construction projects like building the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River.

### Decomposition Reactions
In a **decomposition reaction**, a single **compound** breaks down into two or more simpler substances. The general equation for a decomposition reaction is:

AB → A + B

An example of a decomposition reaction in Ghana is the breakdown of **hydrogen peroxide** (H2O2) into water and oxygen gas:

2H2O2(l) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g)

Hydrogen peroxide is used as a disinfectant and bleaching agent in many Ghanaian homes and industries.

### Single Displacement Reactions
In a **single displacement reaction**, a more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from a compound. The general equation for a single displacement reaction is:

A + BC → AC + B

An example of a single displacement reaction in Ghana is the reaction between **zinc** and **hydrochloric acid** to produce zinc chloride and hydrogen gas:

Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)

This reaction can be demonstrated using locally available materials:

### Double Displacement Reactions 
In a **double displacement reaction**, two compounds swap their positive and negative ions to form two new compounds. The general equation for a double displacement reaction is:

AB + CD → AD + CB

An example of a double displacement reaction in Ghana is the reaction between **lead(II) nitrate** and **potassium iodide** to produce lead(II) iodide and potassium nitrate:

Pb(NO3)2(aq) + 2KI(aq) → PbI2(s) + 2KNO3(aq)  

This reaction results in the formation of a bright yellow solid, lead(II) iodide, which is an example of a **precipitate**.

Types of Chemical Reactions:

| Type                  | General Equation   | Example                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------- |
| Synthesis             | A + B → AB         | CaO + CO2 → CaCO3                    |
| Decomposition         | AB → A + B         | 2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2                    | 
| Single Displacement   | A + BC → AC + B    | Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl2 + H2               |
| Double Displacement   | AB + CD → AD + CB  | Pb(NO3)2 + 2KI → PbI2 + 2KNO3        |

Solubility Rules for Common Ionic Compounds:

| Soluble Compounds                        | Insoluble Compounds          |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Nitrates (NO3-)                          | Carbonates (CO32-)           |
| Chlorides (Cl-), except Ag+, Hg2+, Pb2+ | Sulfides (S2-)               |  
| Sulfates (SO42-), except Ca2+, Ba2+, Pb2+| Hydroxides (OH-), except Group 1 |
| Group 1 compounds, ammonium (NH4+)       | Phosphates (PO43-)           |

## Worked Examples
1. Predict the products of the following synthesis reaction and balance the equation:
   Fe(s) + O2(g) →
   
   Answer: 
   Reactants: Iron (Fe) and oxygen (O2)
   Product: Iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3)
   
   Balanced equation: 4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) → 2Fe2O3(s)

2. Write the balanced chemical equation for the decomposition of potassium chlorate (KClO3) into potassium chloride (KCl) and oxygen gas (O2).
   
   Answer:
   Reactant: Potassium chlorate (KClO3)
   Products: Potassium chloride (KCl) and oxygen gas (O2)
   
   Balanced equation: 2KClO3(s) → 2KCl(s) + 3O2(g)

## Summary
- The four main types of chemical reactions are synthesis, decomposition, single displacement, and double displacement.
- Synthesis reactions involve two or more reactants combining to form a single product (A + B → AB).
- Decomposition reactions involve a single compound breaking down into two or more simpler substances (AB → A + B).
- Single displacement reactions involve a more reactive element displacing a less reactive element from a compound (A + BC → AC + B).
- Double displacement reactions involve two compounds swapping their positive and negative ions to form two new compounds (AB + CD → AD + CB).
- Solubility rules help predict whether a compound will be soluble or insoluble in water.
