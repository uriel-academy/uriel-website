## Learning Objectives
By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
1. List and explain the seven characteristics of living things
2. Differentiate between living and non-living things based on their characteristics
3. Understand the importance of each characteristic for the survival of living organisms
4. Provide examples of living things found in Ghana and their unique adaptations

## Introduction
Living things are all around us, from the towering silk cotton trees in our forests to the tiny mosquitoes that buzz in our ears at night. As Ghanaians, we are surrounded by an incredible diversity of life, from the cocoa plants that provide a livelihood for many farmers to the colorful birds that soar above our heads. But what exactly makes something alive? In this chapter, we will explore the seven characteristics that all living things share, and how these characteristics help organisms survive and thrive in their environments.

Understanding the characteristics of living things is essential for many aspects of our lives in Ghana. For example, knowing how plants respond to their environment can help cocoa farmers optimize their yields, while understanding how diseases spread can help us prevent outbreaks of malaria and other tropical illnesses. By learning about the fundamental properties of life, we can better appreciate the incredible diversity of living things that call Ghana home, and take steps to protect and preserve them for future generations.

## Main Content
### The Seven Characteristics of Living Things
All living things, from the smallest bacteria to the largest elephant, share seven key characteristics that distinguish them from non-living objects. These characteristics are:

1. **Movement**: Living things can move in response to stimuli in their environment. This could be a plant growing towards sunlight or an animal running away from a predator.

2. **Respiration**: Living things take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide (CO2) to release energy from food through cellular respiration. The chemical equation for cellular respiration is:

C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy

3. **Sensitivity**: Living things can respond to changes in their environment, such as temperature or pH, thanks to specialized cells called **receptors**.

4. **Growth**: Living things increase in size and complexity over time, through a process called cellular division or **mitosis**.

5. **Reproduction**: Living things can make new organisms similar to themselves, either through sexual reproduction (involving the fusion of male and female gametes) or asexual reproduction (such as budding or binary fission).

6. **Excretion**: Living things eliminate metabolic waste products from their bodies, such as urea, ammonia, or CO2.

7. **Nutrition**: Living things obtain energy and nutrients from their environment, either by producing their own food (**autotrophic nutrition**, e.g., photosynthesis in plants) or by consuming other organisms (**heterotrophic nutrition**, e.g., animals eating plants or other animals).

### Comparing Living and Non-Living Things

| Characteristic | Living Things | Non-Living Things |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Movement       | Can move on their own | Cannot move on their own |
| Respiration    | Perform respiration | Do not perform respiration |
| Sensitivity    | Respond to stimuli | Do not respond to stimuli |
| Growth         | Grow and develop | Do not grow or develop |
| Reproduction   | Can reproduce   | Cannot reproduce |
| Excretion      | Excrete wastes | Do not excrete wastes |
| Nutrition      | Require nutrition | Do not require nutrition |

### Adaptations of Living Things in Ghana
Living things in Ghana have evolved unique adaptations to help them survive in their specific environments. For example:

- The Nile crocodile, found in the Volta River, has a streamlined body and powerful tail that make it an excellent swimmer and ambush predator.
- The baobab tree has a thick, water-storing trunk that allows it to survive long periods of drought in the savanna regions of Ghana.
- The giant African snail, a common agricultural pest, has a hard, protective shell that helps it retain moisture and defend against predators.

### Experiment: Demonstrating Sensitivity in Plants
You can demonstrate the sensitivity of living things using a simple experiment with a local plant, such as a bean seedling.

Materials:
- 2 bean seedlings in pots
- A box with a hole cut in one side
- A light source (e.g., a lamp or sunlight)

Procedure:
1. Place one bean seedling in the box, with the hole facing the light source.
2. Place the other bean seedling outside the box, also facing the light source.
3. Leave the seedlings for a few days, ensuring they receive equal amounts of water.
4. Observe the growth and orientation of the seedlings over time.

The seedling inside the box will grow towards the hole, demonstrating its sensitivity to light (**phototropism**). The seedling outside the box will grow straight up, towards the light source.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculating the energy released during cellular respiration:
If 1 mole of glucose (C6H12O6) is completely oxidized during cellular respiration, how much energy is released? (Hint: The standard enthalpy of combustion for glucose is -2,805 kJ/mol)

Solution:
The chemical equation for cellular respiration is:
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy

From the given information, we know that the energy released is equal to the standard enthalpy of combustion for glucose, which is -2,805 kJ/mol.

Therefore, when 1 mole of glucose is completely oxidized during cellular respiration, 2,805 kJ of energy is released.

2. Determining the mode of nutrition:
A student observes an organism that has chloroplasts in its cells and can produce its own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. What mode of nutrition does this organism exhibit?

Solution:
The presence of chloroplasts and the ability to produce food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide indicates that the organism is capable of photosynthesis. Organisms that can produce their own food through photosynthesis are called **autotrophs** and exhibit **autotrophic nutrition**.

Therefore, the organism in question exhibits autotrophic nutrition.

## Summary
- Living things share seven characteristics: movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, reproduction, excretion, and nutrition.
- These characteristics distinguish living things from non-living objects and are essential for the survival of organisms.
- Living things in Ghana have unique adaptations that help them survive in their specific environments, such as the water-storing trunk of the baobab tree.
- Cellular respiration is a key process in living things, releasing energy from glucose in the presence of oxygen.
- Autotrophic nutrition involves organisms producing their own food through processes like photosynthesis, while heterotrophic nutrition involves consuming other organisms for energy and nutrients.
