# Chapter 4: Genetics and Evolution
## Section: Genetic Variation

## Learning Objectives
- Explain the role of DNA in determining the characteristics of organisms
- Describe the process of meiosis and how it leads to genetic variation
- Understand how mutations can lead to changes in traits
- Analyze the importance of genetic diversity in populations, using examples from Ghanaian ecosystems

## Introduction
Genetic variation is the foundation of life's incredible diversity, from the vibrant colors of the Ghanaian flag to the rich flavors of local dishes like fufu and jollof rice. Just as these cultural elements make Ghana unique, the genetic differences among organisms allow species to adapt and thrive in various environments. Cocoa farmers in Ghana rely on the genetic diversity of their crops to ensure a bountiful harvest, while the Volta River's diverse aquatic life is a testament to the power of genetic variation in maintaining healthy ecosystems. By understanding the mechanisms behind genetic variation, students can appreciate the interconnectedness of life and the importance of preserving biodiversity in Ghana and beyond.

## Main Content
### DNA: The Blueprint of Life
**Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)** is the molecular basis of heredity, containing the instructions for an organism's development and function. DNA is composed of four **nucleotide bases**: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). These bases pair up (A with T, G with C) to form the rungs of the DNA ladder, while the sugar-phosphate backbone forms the sides.

The sequence of these base pairs determines the **genetic code**, which instructs cells on how to produce specific proteins. Proteins, in turn, determine the traits and characteristics of an organism.

### Meiosis: The Key to Genetic Diversity
Meiosis is a type of cell division that produces **gametes** (reproductive cells) with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This process is crucial for maintaining the correct number of chromosomes in offspring and introducing genetic variation.

The steps of meiosis are as follows:
1. Prophase I
2. Metaphase I
3. Anaphase I
4. Telophase I
5. Prophase II
6. Metaphase II
7. Anaphase II
8. Telophase II

During prophase I, **crossing over** occurs, where homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, resulting in new combinations of alleles. This, along with the random segregation of chromosomes during anaphase I and II, contributes to the genetic diversity of gametes.

### Mutations: Agents of Change
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can lead to altered traits or characteristics. They can occur due to errors during DNA replication or exposure to **mutagens** such as UV radiation or certain chemicals.

Types of mutations include:
- Point mutations (substitution, insertion, deletion)
- Chromosomal mutations (translocation, inversion, duplication)

While many mutations are harmless or even beneficial, some can have negative effects on an organism's health or survival. For example, sickle cell anemia, a genetic disorder prevalent in some regions of Ghana, is caused by a point mutation in the gene that codes for hemoglobin.

### Genetic Diversity in Ghanaian Ecosystems
Genetic diversity is essential for the health and resilience of populations and ecosystems. In Ghana, the tropical rainforests are home to an astonishing array of plant and animal species, each with unique genetic variations that allow them to adapt to their environment.

The table below compares the importance of genetic diversity in two Ghanaian ecosystems:

| Ecosystem | Importance of Genetic Diversity |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Tropical Rainforest | - Enables species to adapt to changing environmental conditions<br>- Provides resistance to pests and diseases<br>- Maintains ecosystem stability and resilience |
| Coastal Wetlands | - Allows species to cope with varying salinity levels<br>- Promotes adaptation to rising sea levels due to climate change<br>- Supports diverse food webs and nutrient cycling |

Practical Example: Students can explore genetic diversity in their local environment by collecting leaf samples from different plants of the same species (e.g., plantain or cassava). They can observe and record variations in leaf shape, size, and color, then discuss how these differences might be advantageous in different microhabitats.

## Worked Examples
1. In a population of 1,000 Ghanaian cocoa trees, 640 have brown pods, and 360 have green pods. Calculate the frequency of the allele for brown pods (B) and green pods (b), assuming the trait is determined by a single gene with two alleles.

Solution:
Let p = frequency of B allele, and q = frequency of b allele
p + q = 1
p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1

Brown pods (BB or Bb): 640/1,000 = 0.64 = p^2 + 2pq
Green pods (bb): 360/1,000 = 0.36 = q^2

p^2 + 2pq = 0.64
q^2 = 0.36
q = √0.36 = 0.6
p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

Therefore, the frequency of the B allele is 0.4, and the frequency of the b allele is 0.6.

2. In a cross between two heterozygous tall Ghanaian maize plants (Tt), what proportion of the offspring is expected to be short (tt)?

Solution:
Parental genotypes: Tt × Tt
Gametes: T, t × T, t
Punnett square:
|   | T | t |
|---|---|---|
| T | TT| Tt|
| t | Tt| tt|

Genotypic ratio: 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt
Phenotypic ratio: 3 tall : 1 short

Therefore, 1/4 or 25% of the offspring is expected to be short (tt).
