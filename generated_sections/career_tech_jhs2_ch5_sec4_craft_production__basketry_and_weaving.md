## Introduction
Basketry and weaving are ancient craft traditions with a long history in Ghana. From the skilled kente weavers of the Ashanti region to the colorful baskets sold in markets across the country, these crafts are an important part of Ghanaian culture and economy. Many Ghanaians make a living through basketry and weaving, supplying useful and beautiful products for local use and export. Learning these skills can provide a foundation for a future career as an artisan, entrepreneur, or designer. In this section, we will explore the materials, tools, and techniques used in basketry and weaving, and learn how to create our own functional and decorative crafts.

## Main Content

### Materials and Tools for Basketry and Weaving
The first step in any basketry or weaving project is selecting the right **materials**. In Ghana, baskets are often made from natural plant fibers like elephant grass, raffia palm, and bamboo. For weaving, **cotton** and **silk** threads are commonly used, as well as synthetic fibers like **rayon** and **polyester**. Other important materials include **dyes** for coloring fibers and **finishes** for protecting the completed project.

The tools used in basketry and weaving range from simple to complex. For basketry, you will need:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Scissors or knife | Cutting fibers to size |
| Awl or needle | Piercing holes in coiled baskets |
| Measuring tape | Ensuring even sizing |
| Spray bottle | Keeping fibers damp and pliable |

For weaving, important tools include:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Frame loom | Holding warp threads in place |
| Shuttle | Carrying weft thread through the warp |
| Beater or comb | Pushing the weft threads tightly together |
| Skeiner | Measuring and winding thread |

### Basketry Techniques: Coiling
**Coiling** is a popular basketry technique in which a core fiber is wrapped with a thinner fiber to create a spiraling, circular shape. To create a coiled basket:

1. Cut the core fiber into thin, even strips using scissors or a knife.
2. Dampen the strips with water to make them pliable.
3. Wrap the core strip tightly with the thinner wrapping fiber, piercing the core with an awl or needle to secure it.
4. Continue wrapping and coiling, gradually increasing the size of the coil to create the walls of the basket.
5. To finish, tuck the end of the wrapping fiber securely into the coil.

### Weaving Techniques: Frame Loom
A simple **frame loom** is an easy way to get started with weaving. To set up a frame loom:

1. Stretch the **warp** threads vertically between the top and bottom of the loom frame, securing them tightly.
2. Use a shuttle to carry the **weft** thread horizontally through the warp threads, alternating over and under each warp thread.
3. Use a beater or comb to push the weft threads tightly together after each pass.
4. Continue weaving until the desired length is reached.
5. Tie off the warp threads and remove the finished fabric from the loom.

### Safety Precautions
When working with sharp tools and materials, always take proper safety precautions:

- Wear protective gloves when handling rough fibers or sharp tools
- Work in a well-ventilated area when using dyes or finishes
- Keep your work area clean and organized to prevent accidents
- Supervise young children closely during crafting activities

## Practical Activity
### Woven Placemat
Create a simple woven placemat using a frame loom and cotton threads.

Materials:
- Frame loom
- Cotton warp thread
- Cotton weft thread in various colors
- Shuttle
- Beater or comb
- Scissors

Instructions:
1. Set up your frame loom with the cotton warp thread, following the instructions in the "Weaving Techniques" section above.
2. Choose 3-4 colors of cotton weft thread to create a striped pattern.
3. Weave the colored weft threads through the warp, alternating colors every few rows to create stripes.
4. Continue weaving until the placemat reaches the desired size (about 30cm x 45cm).
5. Tie off the warp threads and remove the finished placemat from the loom.
6. Trim any loose threads and enjoy your new placemat!
