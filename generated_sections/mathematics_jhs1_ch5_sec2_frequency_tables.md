## Introduction
In our daily lives, we often deal with large amounts of data, whether it's the prices of different items at the market, the number of mobile money transactions we make, or the crop yields on a farm. As Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE, it's essential to understand how to organize and interpret this data effectively. One powerful tool for achieving this is the frequency table.

Frequency tables allow us to summarize data by grouping it into categories and counting the number of occurrences in each category. By learning how to create and analyze frequency tables, you'll be better equipped to make sense of the data you encounter in your studies and everyday life, setting you up for success in your BECE exams and beyond.

## Main Content
### What is a Frequency Table?
A **frequency table** is a way of organizing and summarizing data by grouping it into categories and counting the number of occurrences (or frequency) in each category. The table consists of two main columns:
1. The **category** or **class** column, which lists the different groups or intervals into which the data is divided
2. The **frequency** column, which shows the number of data points that fall into each category

### Creating a Frequency Table
To create a frequency table, follow these steps:
1. Collect the data you want to organize
2. Identify the categories or classes into which you will group the data
3. Count the number of data points that fall into each category
4. Record the counts in the frequency column of the table

For example, let's say you surveyed 20 students about the number of hours they spend studying for the BECE each week. The data you collected is as follows:
```
3, 5, 2, 6, 4, 3, 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 5, 4, 3, 7
```

To create a frequency table, you might group the data into the following categories:
- 1-2 hours
- 3-4 hours
- 5-6 hours
- 7-8 hours

Counting the number of students in each category, you would get the following frequency table:

| Hours Studying per Week | Frequency |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| 1-2                     | 2         |
| 3-4                     | 8         |
| 5-6                     | 8         |
| 7-8                     | 2         |

### Calculating Total Frequency and Relative Frequency
The **total frequency** is the sum of all the frequencies in the table. In the example above, the total frequency is:
```
2 + 8 + 8 + 2 = 20
```

The **relative frequency** for each category is the frequency of that category divided by the total frequency. It represents the proportion or percentage of data points in each category. To calculate the relative frequency, use the following formula:
```
Relative Frequency = Frequency ÷ Total Frequency
```

For the "3-4 hours" category in the example, the relative frequency would be:
```
Relative Frequency = 8 ÷ 20 = 0.4 or 40%
```

Here's the updated frequency table with the relative frequencies:

| Hours Studying per Week | Frequency | Relative Frequency |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1-2                     | 2         | 0.1 or 10%        |
| 3-4                     | 8         | 0.4 or 40%        |
| 5-6                     | 8         | 0.4 or 40%        |
| 7-8                     | 2         | 0.1 or 10%        |

### Interpreting Frequency Tables
Frequency tables provide a clear and concise way to view the distribution of data across different categories. By examining the frequencies and relative frequencies, you can gain insights into the data, such as:
- Which categories have the highest or lowest frequencies
- How the data is distributed among the categories (evenly or unevenly)
- What percentage of the data falls into each category

In the example above, you can see that most students (80%) spend between 3 and 6 hours studying for the BECE each week, with an equal number of students in the "3-4 hours" and "5-6 hours" categories. Only a small percentage of students (20%) fall into the extreme categories of "1-2 hours" and "7-8 hours".

## Worked Examples
1. A market trader recorded the weights (in kg) of 30 bags of rice sold in a day:
```
25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30
```

Create a frequency table for the data, using intervals of 5 kg.

[IMAGE: A frequency table with weight categories and frequencies]

| Weight (kg) | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| 25-29       | 9         |
| 30-34       | 9         |
| 35-39       | 9         |
| 40-44       | 3         |

To create the frequency table:
1. Group the data into intervals of 5 kg: 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and 40-44
2. Count the number of bags in each weight category
3. Record the frequencies in the table

2. A teacher recorded the scores of 40 students on a BECE practice test out of 100 marks. The scores were as follows:
```
85, 92, 78, 60, 88, 75, 90, 82, 65, 98, 72, 80, 95, 68, 87, 62, 93, 77, 58, 89, 73, 84, 91, 67, 96, 70, 83, 94, 63, 86, 76, 81, 97, 71, 90, 69, 79, 88, 74, 66
```

a) Create a frequency table for the scores using the following intervals: 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-99.
b) Calculate the relative frequencies for each interval.

a) [IMAGE: A frequency table with score intervals and frequencies]

| Score Interval | Frequency |
|----------------|-----------|
| 50-59          | 1         |
| 60-69          | 8         |
| 70-79          | 11        |
| 80-89          | 12        |
| 90-99          | 8         |

b) To calculate the relative frequencies, divide each frequency by the total number of students (40):

| Score Interval | Frequency | Relative Frequency           |
|----------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| 50-59          | 1         | 1 ÷ 40 = 0.025 or 2.5%       |
| 60-69          | 8         | 8 ÷ 40 = 0.2 or 20%          |
| 70-79          | 11        | 11 ÷ 40 = 0.275 or 27.5%     |
| 80-89          | 12        | 12 ÷ 40 = 0.3 or 30%         |
| 90-99          | 8         | 8 ÷ 40 = 0.2 or 20%          |

3. A mobile money agent recorded the number of transactions processed each day for a week:
```
Monday: 120
Tuesday: 95
Wednesday: 105
Thursday: 110
Friday: 125
Saturday: 140
Sunday: 80
```

Create a frequency table for the data.

[IMAGE: A frequency table with days and frequencies]

| Day       | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Monday    | 120       |
| Tuesday   | 95        |
| Wednesday | 105       |
| Thursday  | 110       |
| Friday    | 125       |
| Saturday  | 140       |
| Sunday    | 80        |

Since each day has a unique frequency, there's no need to group the data into intervals. Simply list the days and their corresponding frequencies in the table.

## Practice Problems
1. A farmer recorded the number of eggs collected from his chickens each day for a week:
```
35, 28, 32, 30, 36, 29, 33
```
Create a frequency table for the data, using intervals of 5 eggs.

2. A teacher recorded the heights (in cm) of 25 students in her class:
```
142, 138, 150, 146, 139, 152, 144, 148, 137, 145, 140, 149, 143, 151, 141, 147, 136, 153, 139, 150, 144, 148, 142, 146, 140
```
a) Create a frequency table for the heights using the following intervals: 135-139, 140-144, 145-149, 150-154.
b) Calculate the relative frequencies for each interval.

3. The number of customers visiting a shop each day for a week was recorded as follows:
```
Monday: 50
Tuesday: 35
Wednesday: 45
Thursday: 55
Friday: 60
Saturday: 70
Sunday: 40
```
Create a frequency table for the data and calculate the relative frequencies for each day.
