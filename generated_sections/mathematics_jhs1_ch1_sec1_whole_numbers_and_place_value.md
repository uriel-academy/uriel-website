# Chapter 1: Number and Numeration
## Section: Whole Numbers and Place Value

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of place value in whole numbers.
2. Read and write whole numbers up to billions.
3. Compare and order whole numbers using place value.

## Introduction
Mathematics plays a crucial role in our daily lives, and understanding whole numbers is essential for Ghanaian students. Imagine you're at the market, and you need to calculate the total cost of your purchases. Or perhaps you're helping your family on the farm, and you need to measure the area of a field. In both cases, you'll be working with whole numbers. As you prepare for the BECE exam, mastering whole numbers and place value will give you a strong foundation for success in mathematics.

In this section, we'll explore the world of whole numbers and place value. We'll learn how to read and write large numbers, compare and order them, and round them to different place values. These skills will help you in various aspects of your life, from managing your mobile money account to excelling in your future career.

### Understanding Place Value
In the decimal number system, each digit in a number has a specific place value. The place value of a digit depends on its position in the number. For example, in the number 5,678, the place values are as follows:

| Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |
|-----------|----------|------|------|
| 5         | 6        | 7    | 8    |

The value of each digit is determined by multiplying the digit by its place value. For instance, in the number 5,678:
- 5 is in the thousands place, so its value is 5 × 1,000 = 5,000
- 6 is in the hundreds place, so its value is 6 × 100 = 600
- 7 is in the tens place, so its value is 7 × 10 = 70
- 8 is in the ones place, so its value is 8 × 1 = 8

The sum of these values gives us the total value of the number: 5,000 + 600 + 70 + 8 = 5,678.

### Reading and Writing Whole Numbers
Whole numbers can be read and written using place value. Here's a table showing the place values up to billions:

| Billions | Hundred Millions | Ten Millions | Millions | Hundred Thousands | Ten Thousands | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |
|----------|------------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|------|------|

To read a whole number, start from the left and read each group of three digits as hundreds, tens, and ones, followed by the place value name. For example, the number 123,456,789 is read as "one hundred twenty-three million, four hundred fifty-six thousand, seven hundred eighty-nine."

To write a whole number in words, start from the left and write each group of three digits as hundreds, tens, and ones, followed by the place value name. Use commas to separate each group of three digits. For example, "two billion, five hundred eighty-seven million, three hundred forty-one thousand, six hundred twenty-five" is written as 2,587,341,625.

### Comparing and Ordering Whole Numbers
To compare two whole numbers, start from the leftmost digit and compare the digits in each place value. If the digits in the leftmost place value are different, the number with the greater digit in that place value is the greater number. If the digits in the leftmost place value are the same, move to the next place value and repeat the process until you find a difference or reach the end of the numbers.

For example, to compare 3,452 and 3,427:
- Both numbers have the same digit in the thousands place (3).
- In the hundreds place, 3,452 has a greater digit (4) than 3,427 (4 > 2).
- Therefore, 3,452 > 3,427.

To order a set of whole numbers, compare the numbers two at a time using the method described above. Arrange the numbers in ascending (smallest to largest) or descending (largest to smallest) order.

### Rounding Whole Numbers
Rounding a whole number means finding the nearest value at a specific place value. To round a number to a particular place value, follow these steps:
1. Identify the digit in the place value you want to round to.
2. Look at the digit to the right of the identified digit.
   - If the digit to the right is 5 or greater, add 1 to the identified digit.
   - If the digit to the right is less than 5, keep the identified digit as it is.
3. Replace all the digits to the right of the identified digit with zeros.

For example, to round 7,841 to the nearest thousand:
1. The digit in the thousands place is 7.
2. The digit to the right of 7 is 8, which is greater than 5.
3. Add 1 to 7, making it 8, and replace all digits to the right with zeros.
4. The result is 8,000.

## Worked Examples
1. Write the number 4,567,890,123 in words.
   
   Solution:
   "Four billion, five hundred sixty-seven million, eight hundred ninety thousand, one hundred twenty-three"

2. Compare the numbers 23,451 and 23,415.

   Solution:
   - Both numbers have the same digits in the ten thousands and thousands places (2 and 3).
   - In the hundreds place, 23,451 has a greater digit (4) than 23,415 (4 > 1).
   - Therefore, 23,451 > 23,415.

3. Round 56,782 to the nearest hundred.

   Solution:
   1. The digit in the hundreds place is 7.
   2. The digit to the right of 7 is 8, which is greater than 5.
   3. Add 1 to 7, making it 8, and replace all digits to the right with zeros.
   4. The result is 56,800.

4. Kofi has GH₵1,254,890 in his mobile money account. He wants to withdraw some money to buy a new tractor for his farm. The tractor costs GH₵985,000. How much money will Kofi have left in his account after buying the tractor?

   Solution:
   - Kofi's current account balance: GH₵1,254,890
   - Tractor cost: GH₵985,000
   - To find the remaining balance, subtract the tractor cost from Kofi's current balance:
     1,254,890 - 985,000 = 269,890
   - Therefore, Kofi will have GH₵269,890 left in his account after buying the tractor.

## Practice Problems
