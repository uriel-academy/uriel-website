When choosing fabric for your project, consider the type of item you want to make and the properties of the fabric. For example, cotton is a good choice for beginners because it is easy to work with and comfortable to wear. Other popular fabrics in Ghana include ankara, kente, and batik.

### Basic Stitches
Before you can create a sewn item, you need to learn some basic stitches. Two important stitches for beginners are the running stitch and the backstitch.

**Running stitch:**
1. Thread your needle and knot the end.
2. Push the needle up through the fabric, then down again a short distance away.
3. Continue in a straight line, keeping the stitches even.

**Backstitch:**
1. Start with a running stitch.
2. To make a backstitch, bring the needle up through the fabric a stitch length away from the end of the previous stitch.
3. Push the needle down through the end of the previous stitch.
4. Bring the needle up again a stitch length away and repeat.
