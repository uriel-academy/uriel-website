## Introduction
Imagine you are Kofi, a student living in Accra, the vibrant capital of Ghana. As you walk to school with your friend Ama, you discuss the upcoming Independence Day celebrations. You both feel proud of Ghana's achievements since gaining independence in 1957. However, you also wonder about the challenges Ghana faced in the early years of nationhood and how the country has developed since then.

## Main Content
### The Early Years of Independence (1957-1966)
Ghana gained independence from British colonial rule on March 6, 1957, with **Kwame Nkrumah** becoming the country's first Prime Minister. Nkrumah's government focused on developing infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Notable achievements during this period include:
- Construction of the **Akosombo Dam** (completed in 1965)
- Establishment of the **University of Ghana** (1961)
- Implementation of free and compulsory primary education

However, Ghana also faced challenges such as:
- Political opposition and regional tensions
- Economic difficulties due to fluctuating cocoa prices
- Growing foreign debt

### The National Liberation Council and Progress Party Era (1966-1972)
In 1966, Nkrumah's government was overthrown in a military coup led by the **National Liberation Council (NLC)**. The NLC handed power to the democratically elected **Progress Party**, led by **Dr. Kofi Abrefa Busia**, in 1969. During this period:
1. The Ghanaian cedi was introduced as the national currency (1965)
2. The Busia government implemented austerity measures to address economic issues
3. Rural development and agricultural production were prioritized

### The National Redemption Council and Supreme Military Council Years (1972-1979)
Ghana experienced a series of military coups and changes in government during the 1970s:

| Period | Government |
|--------|------------|
| 1972-1975 | National Redemption Council (NRC) |
| 1975-1978 | Supreme Military Council I (SMC I) |
| 1978-1979 | Supreme Military Council II (SMC II) |

These governments faced challenges such as:
- Economic instability and high inflation
- Corruption and mismanagement
- Social unrest and labor strikes

## Examples
1. The construction of the **Tema Motorway**, Ghana's first motorway, began in 1964 during Nkrumah's era. It connected the port city of Tema to Accra, facilitating trade and transportation.

2. In 1969, the Busia government introduced the **Aliens Compliance Order**, which required all foreigners to obtain residence permits. This led to the expulsion of many West African migrants, particularly Nigerians, affecting Ghana's economy and regional relations.
