## Introduction
Linear graphs and equations are essential mathematical concepts with numerous applications in everyday life. For example, imagine you are selling plantain chips at Makola Market in Accra. You sell small bags for GH₵2 each and large bags for GH₵5 each. To find out how much money you'll make based on the number of bags sold, you can use a linear equation. This equation would help you predict your earnings and make informed decisions about your business.

Understanding linear graphs is also crucial for success in the BECE and WAEC exams. These concepts frequently appear in the Mathematics section, so mastering them will give you an advantage in your academic journey. By connecting linear graphs to real-world situations in Ghana, such as mobile money transactions or farming measurements, you'll develop a deeper understanding of the practical importance of mathematics.

## Main Content
### Plotting Points on a Coordinate Plane
A **coordinate plane** is a two-dimensional surface formed by the intersection of a vertical line called the **y-axis** and a horizontal line called the **x-axis**. The point where the axes intersect is called the **origin** and has coordinates (0, 0). Points on the coordinate plane are represented as ordered pairs (x, y), where x is the horizontal distance from the origin and y is the vertical distance.

To plot a point:
1. Start at the origin (0, 0)
2. Move horizontally along the x-axis according to the x-coordinate (positive values move right, negative values move left)
3. Move vertically along the y-axis according to the y-coordinate (positive values move up, negative values move down)
4. Mark the point at the final location

### Calculating the Gradient of a Line
The **gradient** (or slope) of a line measures its steepness and direction. It is calculated using the following formula:

$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are two points on the line.

To find the gradient:
1. Choose two points on the line
2. Identify their coordinates $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$
3. Substitute the values into the gradient formula
4. Simplify the fraction if possible

Example: Find the gradient of the line passing through points A(1, 2) and B(4, 8).

$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{8 - 2}{4 - 1} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$

So, the gradient of the line is 2.

### Slope-Intercept Form of a Line
The **slope-intercept form** of a linear equation is:

$y = mx + c$

where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis).

Given the gradient and y-intercept, you can write the equation of a line:
1. Identify the gradient (m) and y-intercept (c)
2. Substitute the values into the slope-intercept form: $y = mx + c$

Example: Write the equation of a line with gradient 3 and y-intercept -2.

$m = 3$, $c = -2$
Equation: $y = 3x - 2$

### Determining the Equation of a Line
To find the equation of a line given its graph or two points:
1. If given the graph, identify the gradient (m) and y-intercept (c), then use the slope-intercept form
2. If given two points, first calculate the gradient (m) using the gradient formula
3. Substitute one of the points and the gradient into the slope-intercept form
4. Solve for c (the y-intercept)
5. Write the final equation in slope-intercept form

| Slope-intercept form | $y = mx + c$ |

## Worked Examples
1. Kofi is saving money to buy a new bicycle. He starts with GH₵50 in his savings account and plans to save GH₵20 each week. Write an equation to represent Kofi's savings (y) after x weeks. How much will Kofi have saved after 8 weeks?

   Let x be the number of weeks and y be the amount saved.
   - Starting amount (y-intercept): GH₵50
   - Amount saved per week (gradient): GH₵20
   
   Slope-intercept form: $y = mx + c$
   Equation: $y = 20x + 50$

   After 8 weeks: $y = 20(8) + 50 = 160 + 50 = 210$
   
   Therefore, Kofi will have saved GH₵210 after 8 weeks.

2. [IMAGE: A graph showing two points: P(-2, 1) and Q(3, -5). The question asks to find the equation of the line passing through these points.]

   First, calculate the gradient:
   $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-5 - 1}{3 - (-2)} = \frac{-6}{5}$

   Now, use point P(-2, 1) and the gradient to find the y-intercept:
   $1 = \frac{-6}{5}(-2) + c$
   $1 = \frac{12}{5} + c$
   $c = 1 - \frac{12}{5} = \frac{5}{5} - \frac{12}{5} = \frac{-7}{5}$

   The equation of the line is: $y = \frac{-6}{5}x - \frac{7}{5}$

3. A mobile money agent charges a fixed fee of GH₵0.50 plus 1% of the transaction amount for each transaction. Write an equation to represent the total charge (y) for a transaction of x Ghana Cedis. Calculate the total charge for a transaction of GH₵200.

   Let x be the transaction amount and y be the total charge.
   - Fixed fee (y-intercept): GH₵0.50
   - Variable fee (gradient): 1% of the transaction amount = 0.01x
   
   Equation: $y = 0.01x + 0.50$

   For a transaction of GH₵200: $y = 0.01(200) + 0.50 = 2 + 0.50 = 2.50$
   
   The total charge for a GH₵200 transaction is GH₵2.50.

## Practice Problems
1. Plot the points A(2, -3), B(-1, 4), and C(0, 0) on a coordinate plane. Then, find the gradient of the line passing through points A and B.

2. Write the equation of the line with a y-intercept of 3 and a gradient of -2.

3. Ama is planning to buy new textbooks for the upcoming BECE exams. She has saved GH₵120 so far and plans to save an additional GH₵15 per week. Write an equation to represent Ama's savings (y) after x weeks. How many weeks will it take Ama to save a total of GH₵300?

Answers:
1. Gradient = $\frac{7}{3}$
2. $y = -2x + 3$
3. Equation: $y = 15x + 120$, 12 weeks
