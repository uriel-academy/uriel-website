Origami is the art of folding square paper into 3D shapes and figures, without using glue or scissors. By learning a few basic folds, you can create an endless variety of designs.

Follow these steps to fold a simple origami heart:
1. Start with a square piece of origami paper, colored side down. 
2. Fold the paper in half vertically, crease, then unfold.
3. Fold the top corners down to the center crease.
4. Fold the point at the top of the heart down, about 1/3 of the way.
5. Fold the sides in towards the center.
6. Complete your heart by folding the bottom point up.

## Practical Activity
Let's apply our paper crafting skills to create a product commonly sold by Ghanaian businesses - a customized gift bag. You'll use measuring, cutting, folding, and decoupage techniques.

Materials:
- 2 sheets of 12x18 inch cardstock or kraft paper 
- Scissors
- Ruler
- Pencil
- Decorative paper like kente or adinkra-patterned wrapping paper
- Decoupage glue
- Foam brush

Instructions:
1. Measure and cut your cardstock into a 12x12 inch square. 
2. Fold the square in half diagonally to make a triangle, then unfold. 
3. Fold each corner into the center point.
4. Lift the flaps created by the previous folds, creasing only at the bottom. This forms the bag shape.
5. Cut decorative paper into strips and shapes. Glue onto bag using decoupage technique - apply glue to bag, stick on paper, then seal with another layer of glue. Let dry.
6. Fill your bag with tissue paper or a small gift to complete the look.
