2. Describe examples of adaptation in Ghanaian plants and animals
3. Understand the role of genetic variation in evolution
4. Discuss the evidence for evolution, including fossils and similarities between species

## Introduction
Evolution is the process by which species change over time, adapting to their environments. This is especially important in Ghana, where diverse ecosystems have led to unique adaptations. For example, the cocoa plant, which is vital to Ghana's economy, has evolved to thrive in the tropical climate. Similarly, the Volta River is home to many fish species that have adapted to live in its fast-flowing waters. By understanding evolution, we can better appreciate the incredible diversity of life in Ghana and how it has changed over millions of years.

## Main Content
### Natural Selection
**Natural selection** is the main driver of evolution. It occurs when individuals with certain traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their genes to the next generation. Over time, this leads to changes in the population. For example, in Ghana's tropical forests, trees with deeper roots are better able to access water during dry seasons, making them more likely to survive and reproduce. 

### Adaptation
**Adaptation** is the result of natural selection, where species develop traits that help them survive in their environment. Some examples of adaptation in Ghana include:
- The **sickle cell trait**, which provides resistance to malaria, a common tropical disease
- The **thick fur** of the Mona monkey, which helps it stay cool in the hot climate
- The **long necks** of giraffes, which allow them to reach leaves high in the trees

### Evidence for Evolution
There is strong evidence for evolution from various sources:
1. **Fossils**: Fossils show how species have changed over time, such as the evolution of humans from earlier primates
2. **Similarities between species**: Related species share similar characteristics, suggesting a common ancestor
3. **Embryology**: The embryos of different species often look similar, indicating a shared evolutionary history

| Evidence | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Fossils | Archaeopteryx, a transitional fossil between dinosaurs and birds |
| Similarities | All mammals have a backbone, suggesting a common mammalian ancestor |
| Embryology | Human embryos have gill slits at early stages, like fish embryos |

### Practical: Observing Adaptation
You can observe adaptation in action by examining plants in different environments. Collect leaves from plants in a dry, sunny area and a wet, shady area. Compare their characteristics:

| Characteristic | Dry, Sunny | Wet, Shady |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| Leaf size | Smaller | Larger |
| Leaf thickness | Thicker | Thinner |
| Leaf color | Lighter | Darker |

Plants in dry, sunny areas often have smaller, thicker leaves to reduce water loss, while plants in wet, shady areas have larger, thinner leaves to capture more light for photosynthesis.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculating allele frequency:
In a population of 100 cocoa plants, 25 have a gene for disease resistance (R), while 75 have the non-resistant gene (r). The frequency of the resistant allele is:

Frequency of R = Number of R alleles / Total number of alleles
= (25 × 2) / (100 × 2) = 50/200 = 0.25 or 25%

2. Determining genotype probabilities:
If the frequency of the resistant allele (R) is 0.25 and the non-resistant allele (r) is 0.75, the probabilities of each genotype are:

P(RR) = 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%
P(Rr) = 2 × 0.25 × 0.75 = 0.375 or 37.5%
P(rr) = 0.75 × 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%

## Summary
- Evolution is the change in species over time due to natural selection and adaptation
- Natural selection occurs when individuals with certain traits are more likely to survive and reproduce
- Adaptation is the development of traits that help species survive in their environment
- Evidence for evolution includes fossils, similarities between species, and embryology
- Genetic variation is necessary for evolution to occur, as it provides the raw material for natural selection
