## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify and select appropriate materials for crafting specific products
2. Create design sketches and templates for products
3. Follow step-by-step procedures to create functional prototypes
4. Apply finishing techniques to enhance product appearance and durability
5. Evaluate product designs and suggest improvements

## Introduction
Craft production and product design play a vital role in our daily lives as Ghanaians. From the colorful kente cloth woven by skilled artisans to the delicious waakye served by local food vendors, crafted products are all around us. Ghanaian entrepreneurs, such as tailors, carpenters, and batik makers, use their creativity and technical skills to design and create products that meet the needs of their customers. By learning the fundamentals of product design, you can develop valuable skills that can lead to exciting career opportunities and even help you start your own business.

## Main Content
### Selecting Materials
To create a successful product, it is essential to choose the right materials. Consider the following factors when selecting materials:
- **Functionality**: Choose materials that suit the product's intended purpose
- **Durability**: Select materials that can withstand regular use and environmental conditions
- **Aesthetics**: Consider the appearance of the materials and how they contribute to the overall design
- **Cost**: Choose materials that fit within your budget without compromising quality

### Creating Design Sketches and Templates
Before crafting a product, it is crucial to create design sketches and templates. This helps you visualize the final product and identify potential issues early in the design process.
1. Sketch your initial ideas on paper
2. Refine your sketches and create detailed drawings with measurements
3. Create templates using cardboard or other suitable materials
4. Test your templates to ensure they are accurate and functional

### Crafting Prototypes
Once you have finalized your design and created templates, it's time to craft a prototype. Follow these steps to create a functional prototype:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | Gather materials and tools |
| 2    | Cut materials according to templates |
| 3    | Assemble components using appropriate techniques (e.g., sewing, gluing, nailing) |
| 4    | Test prototype for functionality and make necessary adjustments |

Safety Precautions:
- Wear protective gear (e.g., gloves, goggles) when handling tools and materials
- Work in a well-ventilated area when using adhesives or finishes
- Keep your workspace clean and organized to prevent accidents

### Applying Finishing Techniques
Finishing techniques help enhance the appearance and durability of your product. Some common finishing techniques include:
- Sanding wood surfaces for a smooth finish
- Applying varnish or paint to protect and decorate wood
- Hemming and pressing fabric edges for a neat appearance
- Adding decorative elements (e.g., beads, embroidery) to fabric products

## Practical Activity
Create a functional prototype of a fabric pencil case using the following materials and steps:

Materials:
- Two pieces of fabric (20 cm x 15 cm each)
- Zipper (20 cm long)
- Thread
- Scissors
- Pins
- Sewing machine (or needle for hand sewing)

Steps:
1. Cut fabric pieces to the specified dimensions
2. Pin zipper to the top edge of one fabric piece, right sides together
3. Sew zipper in place using a zipper foot or carefully stitching by hand
4. Pin the second fabric piece to the other side of the zipper, right sides together
5. Sew the second fabric piece in place
6. Open the zipper halfway, then pin the remaining three sides of the fabric pieces together, right sides facing inward
7. Sew the remaining three sides, leaving a small opening for turning
8. Turn the pencil case right-side out through the opening, then stitch the opening closed

Expected Outcome:
A functional, zippered pencil case made from locally available fabric.

## Career Connections
Skills in product design and craft production are valuable in many Ghanaian careers, such as:
- Tailors and seamstresses who design and create garments
- Carpenters who design and build furniture and other wooden products
- Batik makers who create unique fabric designs using wax-resist dyeing techniques
- Entrepreneurs who develop and market their own crafted products

## Summary
- Select appropriate materials based on functionality, durability, aesthetics, and cost
- Create design sketches and templates to visualize and refine product ideas
- Follow step-by-step procedures to craft functional prototypes
- Apply finishing techniques to enhance product appearance and durability
- Evaluate product designs and make improvements based on feedback and testing
- Develop valuable skills that can lead to careers in tailoring, carpentry, batik making, and entrepreneurship
