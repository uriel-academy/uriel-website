### Introduction
Data analysis is an essential skill in our daily lives. As Ghanaian students, you might encounter situations where you need to analyze data, such as calculating your total savings from your mobile money transactions, determining the number of customers who spent more than a certain amount at a market stall, or estimating the yield of a farm based on the number of crops harvested. Cumulative frequency is a powerful tool that allows us to summarize and interpret data effectively. Mastering this concept will not only help you excel in your BECE exams but also enable you to make informed decisions in various aspects of your life.

### Main Content
#### Understanding Cumulative Frequency
**Cumulative frequency** is the running total of frequencies in a frequency distribution. It represents the number of observations that are less than or equal to a particular value. Cumulative frequency helps us determine how many data points lie below a certain value, making it easier to analyze and interpret data.

#### Constructing a Cumulative Frequency Table
To construct a cumulative frequency table, follow these steps:
1. Arrange the data in ascending order.
2. Create a frequency table with the following columns: data values, tally, frequency, and cumulative frequency.
3. Fill in the data values and their corresponding frequencies.
4. Calculate the cumulative frequency by adding each frequency to the sum of the frequencies above it.

Example cumulative frequency table:
| Data Value | Tally | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
|------------|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1-5        | III   | 3         | 3                    |
| 6-10       | IIII  | 4         | 7                    |
| 11-15      | II    | 2         | 9                    |
| 16-20      | I     | 1         | 10                   |

#### Drawing a Cumulative Frequency Curve (Ogive)
An **ogive** is a graphical representation of a cumulative frequency distribution. To draw an ogive:
1. Draw a horizontal axis (x-axis) and a vertical axis (y-axis).
2. Label the x-axis with the data values and the y-axis with the cumulative frequencies.
3. Plot the cumulative frequencies against the upper boundaries of the data values.
4. Connect the points with a smooth curve.

#### Interpreting Cumulative Frequency Tables and Curves
Cumulative frequency tables and curves provide valuable information about the distribution of data. By analyzing them, we can:
- Determine the number of observations below a certain value
- Find the median value (the middle value that separates the lower and upper halves of the data)
- Estimate the percentile rank of a particular value (the percentage of observations below that value)

### Worked Examples
1. The weights (in kg) of 20 students in a class are recorded as follows:
   55, 48, 52, 60, 58, 62, 51, 54, 49, 57, 63, 50, 61, 56, 59, 53, 64, 47, 66, 52
   
   Construct a cumulative frequency table for the data using intervals of 5 kg.
   
   Solution:
   First, arrange the data in ascending order:
   47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66
   
   | Weight (kg) | Tally | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
   |-------------|-------|-----------|----------------------|
   | 45-49       | III   | 3         | 3                    |
   | 50-54       | IIII  | 5         | 8                    |
   | 55-59       | IIII  | 5         | 13                   |
   | 60-64       | IIII  | 6         | 19                   |
   | 65-69       | I     | 1         | 20                   |

2. The table below shows the distribution of scores obtained by students in a BECE mock exam:
   
   | Score | Frequency |
   |-------|-----------|
   | 0-9   | 5         |
   | 10-19 | 12        |
   | 20-29 | 18        |
   | 30-39 | 10        |
   | 40-50 | 5         |
   
   Draw a cumulative frequency curve (ogive) for the data.
   
   Solution:
   First, calculate the cumulative frequencies:
   
   | Score | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
   |-------|-----------|----------------------|
   | 0-9   | 5         | 5                    |
   | 10-19 | 12        | 17                   |
   | 20-29 | 18        | 35                   |
   | 30-39 | 10        | 45                   |
   | 40-50 | 5         | 50                   |
   
   [IMAGE: An ogive with scores on the x-axis and cumulative frequencies on the y-axis. The curve starts at (0, 5) and increases to (50, 50), with points at (9, 5), (19, 17), (29, 35), and (39, 45).]

3. A market trader records the number of customers who spend various amounts (in GH₵) at her stall:
   
   | Amount Spent (GH₵) | Number of Customers |
   |--------------------|---------------------|
   | 0-19               | 15                  |
   | 20-39              | 25                  |
   | 40-59              | 20                  |
   | 60-79              | 10                  |
   | 80-100             | 5                   |
   
   Estimate the number of customers who spent GH₵50 or less.
   
   Solution:
   First, calculate the cumulative frequencies:
   
   | Amount Spent (GH₵) | Number of Customers | Cumulative Frequency |
   |--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
   | 0-19               | 15                  | 15                   |
   | 20-39              | 25                  | 40                   |
   | 40-59              | 20                  | 60                   |
   | 60-79              | 10                  | 70                   |
   | 80-100             | 5                   | 75                   |
   
   From the cumulative frequency table, we can see that 60 customers spent GH₵59 or less. Since GH₵50 falls within the interval 40-59, we can estimate that the number of customers who spent GH₵50 or less is slightly less than 60, around 55-58 customers.

2. [IMAGE: An ogive with marks on the x-axis and cumulative frequencies on the y-axis. The curve starts at (0, 4) and increases to (100, 50), with points at (19, 4), (39, 16), (59, 36), and (79, 46).]

3. From the cumulative frequency table:
   
   | Number of Eggs | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
   |----------------|-----------|----------------------|
   | 0-49           | 5         | 5                    |
   | 50-99          | 15        | 20                   |
   | 100-149        | 20        | 40                   |
   | 150-199        | 8         | 48                   |
   | 200-250        | 2         | 50                   |
   
   The farmer collected 120 eggs or fewer on approximately 40 days.
