## Introduction
Have you ever wondered how your mobile phone communicates with others or how the sun's energy reaches the Earth? The answer lies in the fascinating world of electromagnetic waves. In Ghana, we experience the benefits of electromagnetic waves every day, from the warmth of the sun that helps our cocoa crops grow to the radio waves that broadcast our favorite programs. Understanding the electromagnetic spectrum is crucial for Ghanaian students, as it plays a vital role in various aspects of our lives, such as communication, healthcare, and energy production at the Akosombo Dam.

## Main Content
### What is the Electromagnetic Spectrum?
The **electromagnetic spectrum** is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays. These waves differ in their wavelength, frequency, and energy.

### Properties of Electromagnetic Waves
Electromagnetic waves have three main properties:
1. **Wavelength (λ)**: The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs of a wave.
2. **Frequency (f)**: The number of waves that pass a fixed point in space per unit time.
3. **Energy (E)**: The energy carried by an electromagnetic wave, which is directly proportional to its frequency.

The relationship between wavelength, frequency, and the speed of light (c) is given by the equation:
c = λ × f

| Region | Wavelength Range | Frequency Range |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Radio waves | > 1 mm | < 300 GHz |
| Microwaves | 1 mm - 1 m | 300 MHz - 300 GHz |
| Infrared | 700 nm - 1 mm | 300 GHz - 430 THz |
| Visible light | 400 nm - 700 nm | 430 THz - 750 THz |
| Ultraviolet | 10 nm - 400 nm | 750 THz - 30 PHz |
| X-rays | 0.01 nm - 10 nm | 30 PHz - 30 EHz |
| Gamma rays | < 0.01 nm | > 30 EHz |

### Applications of Electromagnetic Waves in Ghana
1. **Radio waves**: Used in broadcasting (e.g., Radio Ghana) and communication (e.g., mobile phones).
2. **Microwaves**: Used in cooking (microwave ovens), radar technology, and satellite communication.
3. **Infrared**: Used in remote controls, night vision cameras, and thermal imaging for detecting tropical diseases like malaria.
4. **Visible light**: Essential for vision, photosynthesis in plants (including cocoa trees), and solar energy production.
5. **Ultraviolet**: Used in sterilization, water purification, and detection of counterfeit currency.
6. **X-rays**: Used in medical imaging (e.g., diagnosing tuberculosis) and airport security scanners.
7. **Gamma rays**: Used in radiotherapy for cancer treatment and in the sterilization of medical equipment.

### Effects of Electromagnetic Waves on Living Organisms and the Environment
Electromagnetic waves can have both positive and negative effects on living organisms and the environment. For example:
- Ultraviolet radiation from the sun helps in the production of vitamin D but can also cause skin damage and increase the risk of skin cancer.
- Radio waves and microwaves from telecommunication devices can potentially interfere with the navigation systems of some animals, such as birds and bees.
- The Akosombo Dam, which uses the Volta River's water to generate electricity, relies on the sun's energy to maintain the water cycle that feeds the river.

**Practical Activity**: Students can explore the effects of visible light on plant growth by growing two identical plants, one in normal light conditions and another in a dark box. Observe the differences in growth and discuss the importance of light for photosynthesis.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the wavelength of a radio wave with a frequency of 100 MHz. (Speed of light, c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s)

Solution:
- c = λ × f
- λ = c ÷ f
- λ = (3 × 10⁸ m/s) ÷ (100 × 10⁶ Hz)
- λ = 3 m

Therefore, the wavelength of the radio wave is 3 meters.

2. Determine the energy of a photon of green light with a wavelength of 500 nm. (Planck's constant, h = 6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J⋅s)

Solution:
- Energy of a photon, E = h × f
- f = c ÷ λ
- f = (3 × 10⁸ m/s) ÷ (500 × 10⁻⁹ m)
- f = 6 × 10¹⁴ Hz
- E = (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J⋅s) × (6 × 10¹⁴ Hz)
- E = 3.98 × 10⁻¹⁹ J

Therefore, the energy of a photon of green light is 3.98 × 10⁻¹⁹ joules.
