3. Describe the formation of shadows and eclipses
4. Apply knowledge of light energy to real-life situations in Ghana

## Introduction
Light energy is a crucial aspect of our daily lives in Ghana. From the warm sunlight that helps our cocoa crops grow to the illumination provided by electric lights in our homes, light plays a vital role. The sun's light energy is also harnessed at the Akosombo Dam to generate electricity for our nation. Understanding the properties and behavior of light energy will help us better appreciate its importance and apply this knowledge to improve our lives.

## Main Content
### Properties of Light
Light is a form of energy that travels in waves. It is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Light has several key properties:
- **Speed**: Light travels at a constant speed of approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s in a vacuum.
- **Wavelength**: The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs in a light wave.
- **Frequency**: The number of wave cycles that pass a fixed point per second, measured in Hertz (Hz).
- **Amplitude**: The maximum displacement of a wave from its resting position.

### Interaction of Light with Matter
When light encounters different materials, it can interact in three main ways:
1. **Reflection**: When light bounces off a surface, such as a mirror or calm water.
2. **Refraction**: When light bends as it passes from one medium to another, such as from air to water.
3. **Absorption**: When a material takes in light energy, often converting it to heat. Dark-colored materials absorb more light than light-colored ones.

| Interaction | Description                                       | Example                               |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
| Reflection  | Light bounces off a surface                       | Mirrors, calm water surface            |
| Refraction  | Light bends when passing between different media  | Straw appears bent in a glass of water |
| Absorption  | Material takes in light energy, converting to heat| Black t-shirt absorbs more sunlight   |

### Shadows and Eclipses
Shadows form when an opaque object blocks light from reaching a surface. The size and shape of the shadow depend on the size of the object and its distance from the light source. 

Eclipses occur when one celestial body partially or fully blocks the light from another. There are two main types of eclipses:
1. **Solar Eclipse**: When the Moon comes between the Sun and Earth, blocking sunlight.
2. **Lunar Eclipse**: When Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the Moon.

### Practical Experiment: Refraction with a Coconut Shell
You can observe refraction using a coconut shell and water:
1. Cut a coconut in half and remove the flesh.
2. Place a small object (like a coin) at the bottom of the empty coconut shell.
3. Step back until the coin is just hidden from view by the edge of the shell.
4. Carefully pour water into the coconut shell without moving.
5. Observe how the coin becomes visible again due to refraction of light through the water.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculating the speed of light:
   - Light travels 150,000 km in 0.5 seconds. What is the speed of light?
   - Speed = Distance / Time
   - Speed = 150,000 km / 0.5 s = 300,000 km/s or 3 x 10^8 m/s

2. Determining the wavelength of light:
   - If the frequency of a light wave is 6 x 10^14 Hz, what is its wavelength? (Speed of light: 3 x 10^8 m/s)
   - Speed = Wavelength x Frequency
   - 3 x 10^8 m/s = Wavelength x 6 x 10^14 Hz
   - Wavelength = (3 x 10^8 m/s) / (6 x 10^14 Hz) = 5 x 10^-7 m or 500 nm

## Summary
- Light is a form of energy that travels in waves and is the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
- Key properties of light include speed, wavelength, frequency, and amplitude.
- Light interacts with matter through reflection, refraction, and absorption.
- Shadows form when an opaque object blocks light, while eclipses occur when celestial bodies block each other's light.
- Refraction of light can be observed using a simple experiment with a coconut shell and water.
