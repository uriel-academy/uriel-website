2. Describe the structure and function of the main organelles in plant and animal cells.
3. Differentiate between plant and animal cells based on their unique features.
4. Explain the role of cell division in growth, repair, and reproduction of organisms.
5. Perform a practical experiment to observe plant and animal cells under a microscope.

## Introduction
Imagine you are a cocoa farmer in Ghana, carefully tending to your crops. Each cocoa pod contains numerous cocoa beans, which are processed to make the delicious chocolate enjoyed worldwide. Just like the cocoa beans are the fundamental units of the cocoa pod, cells are the basic building blocks of all living organisms. From the smallest bacteria to the giant trees in the tropical rainforests of Ghana, every living thing is composed of one or more cells.

Cells are fascinating structures that perform all the functions necessary for life. They are like tiny factories, with various organelles working together to keep the cell functioning properly. Understanding the structure and function of cells is crucial for Ghanaian students, as it forms the foundation for learning about the diversity of life, from the plants and animals in our local ecosystems to the microorganisms that cause tropical diseases.

## Main Content
### What is a Cell?
A **cell** is the smallest unit of life that can function independently. It is a self-contained structure surrounded by a **cell membrane**, which separates the cell's interior from the external environment. Cells contain various **organelles**, each with a specific function that contributes to the overall functioning of the cell.

### Structure and Function of Cell Organelles
Plant and animal cells share many common organelles, including:

1. **Nucleus**: Contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) and controls cellular activities.
2. **Cytoplasm**: The jelly-like substance where organelles are suspended and cellular reactions occur.
3. **Mitochondria**: The powerhouses of the cell, responsible for producing energy through cellular respiration.
4. **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**: A network of membranes involved in protein and lipid synthesis, as well as transport within the cell.
5. **Golgi Apparatus**: Modifies, packages, and distributes proteins and lipids.
6. **Lysosomes**: Contains digestive enzymes that break down waste materials and cellular debris.
7. **Ribosomes**: Sites of protein synthesis.

### Differences Between Plant and Animal Cells
While plant and animal cells share many similarities, there are some key differences:

| Feature | Plant Cells | Animal Cells |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Cell Wall | Present (composed of cellulose) | Absent |
| Chloroplasts | Present | Absent |
| Vacuoles | Usually one large, central vacuole | Small, multiple vacuoles (if present) |
| Centrioles | Absent | Present |

### Cell Division and Its Importance
Cell division is the process by which cells reproduce to form new cells. It is essential for the growth, repair, and reproduction of organisms. There are two main types of cell division:

1. **Mitosis**: Results in the production of two genetically identical daughter cells. It is responsible for growth and repair of tissues.
2. **Meiosis**: A special type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells, resulting in the formation of gametes (eggs and sperm) with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This is important for maintaining the correct number of chromosomes in offspring after fertilization.

### Practical Experiment: Observing Plant and Animal Cells Under a Microscope
Materials:
- Microscope
- Slides and cover slips
- Onion (Allium cepa)
- Iodine solution
- Toothpick
- Human cheek cells (epithelial cells)
- Methylene blue stain

Procedure:
1. Prepare an onion cell slide by placing a thin layer of onion epidermis on a slide, adding a drop of iodine solution, and covering it with a cover slip.
2. Gently scrape the inside of your cheek with a clean toothpick and smear the cells onto a slide. Add a drop of methylene blue stain and cover with a cover slip.
3. Observe both slides under the microscope at various magnifications, noting the differences between plant and animal cells.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculating the Magnification of a Microscope:
   - If a microscope has an eyepiece with a magnification of 10x and an objective lens with a magnification of 40x, the total magnification can be calculated as follows:
     * Total Magnification = Eyepiece Magnification × Objective Lens Magnification
     * Total Magnification = 10x × 40x = 400x
   - Therefore, an object viewed under this microscope will appear 400 times larger than its actual size.

2. Estimating the Size of a Cell:
   - If an animal cell is observed under a microscope with a total magnification of 400x and appears to be 4 cm in diameter, its actual size can be estimated as follows:
     * Actual Size = Observed Size ÷ Magnification
     * Actual Size = 4 cm ÷ 400 = 0.01 cm
     * Convert cm to μm: 0.01 cm × (10^4 μm / 1 cm) = 100 μm
   - Therefore, the actual diameter of the animal cell is approximately 100 μm.

## Summary
- Cells are the basic units of life and are composed of various organelles that work together to maintain the cell's functions.
- Plant and animal cells share many common organelles, such as the nucleus, cytoplasm, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and ribosomes.
- Plant cells have unique features, including a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a large central vacuole, while animal cells have centrioles and typically lack these features.
- Cell division, through the processes of mitosis and meiosis, is essential for the growth, repair, and reproduction of organisms.
- Microscopes are important tools for observing and studying cells, allowing us to magnify and visualize their structures.
