## Learning Objectives
After completing this section, students will be able to:
1. Add and subtract vectors geometrically and algebraically.
2. Multiply a vector by a scalar.
3. Find the magnitude and direction of a vector.
4. Apply vector operations to solve real-world problems.

## Introduction
Vectors are essential mathematical tools that help us understand and analyze quantities with both magnitude and direction. In Ghana, we encounter vectors in various aspects of our daily lives. For example, when you walk from your home to the market, your displacement can be represented by a vector. The force exerted by the wind on a fishing boat on the Volta Lake can also be described using a vector. Understanding vector operations will not only help you excel in your BECE exams but also enable you to solve practical problems in your future careers, such as in engineering, physics, or computer science.

Imagine you are helping your uncle navigate his boat from Tema to Takoradi. To determine the boat's position at any given time, you need to consider the boat's velocity and the ocean currents, both of which can be represented by vectors. By mastering vector operations, you can accurately calculate the boat's path and estimate its arrival time. This knowledge is crucial for ensuring safe and efficient navigation in Ghana's maritime industry.

## Main Content
### Vector Addition and Subtraction
To add or subtract vectors geometrically, we place the tail of one vector at the head of the other vector. The resultant vector is then drawn from the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector.

Algebraically, we add or subtract the corresponding components of the vectors:
- For vectors $\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2)$ and $\vec{b} = (b_1, b_2)$:
  - Addition: $\vec{a} + \vec{b} = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2)$
  - Subtraction: $\vec{a} - \vec{b} = (a_1 - b_1, a_2 - b_2)$

### Scalar Multiplication
To multiply a vector by a scalar (a real number), we multiply each component of the vector by the scalar:
- For vector $\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2)$ and scalar $c$:
  - Scalar multiplication: $c\vec{a} = (ca_1, ca_2)$

Scalar multiplication can be used to change the magnitude and direction of a vector.

### Magnitude and Direction
The magnitude (length) of a vector $\vec{a} = (a_1, a_2)$ is given by:
- $|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2}$

The direction of a vector can be described using the angle it makes with the positive x-axis:
- $\theta = \tan^{-1}(\frac{a_2}{a_1})$

### Applications of Vector Operations
Vector operations have numerous applications in real-world scenarios:
- Calculating the resultant force acting on an object
- Determining the velocity and acceleration of moving objects
- Analyzing the displacement and distance traveled by an object
- Solving problems related to navigation and transportation

## Worked Examples
1. A farmer in Kumasi walks 3 km east and then 4 km north to reach his cassava farm. Represent his displacement as a vector and find its magnitude.

Solution:
Let the eastward direction be the positive x-axis and the northward direction be the positive y-axis.
The farmer's displacement can be represented by the vector $\vec{d} = (3, 4)$ km.

To find the magnitude:
$|\vec{d}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5$ km

Therefore, the farmer's displacement is 5 km.

2. A boat on the Volta Lake experiences a wind force of 200 N acting 30° north of east and a current force of 150 N acting 60° south of east. Find the resultant force acting on the boat.

[IMAGE: Diagram showing the wind and current forces]

Solution:
Let the eastward direction be the positive x-axis and the northward direction be the positive y-axis.

Wind force: $\vec{F_w} = (200\cos30°, 200\sin30°) = (173.2, 100)$ N
Current force: $\vec{F_c} = (150\cos60°, -150\sin60°) = (75, -129.9)$ N

Resultant force: $\vec{F_r} = \vec{F_w} + \vec{F_c} = (173.2 + 75, 100 - 129.9) = (248.2, -29.9)$ N

Magnitude of the resultant force:
$|\vec{F_r}| = \sqrt{248.2^2 + (-29.9)^2} = 249.4$ N

Therefore, the resultant force acting on the boat is approximately 249.4 N.

3. A mobile money agent in Accra receives GH₵2,000 from a customer who wants to send money to his mother in Tamale. The agent charges a 1.5% fee for the transaction. Calculate the vector representing the money sent and the fee charged.

Solution:
Let the money sent be the positive x-component and the fee charged be the positive y-component.

Money sent: $GH₵2,000$
Fee charged: $1.5\% \times GH₵2,000 = GH₵30$

The vector representing the transaction is $\vec{t} = (2000, 30)$.

## Practice Problems
1. A student walks 500 m south from her school and then 300 m west to reach the bus stop. Represent her displacement as a vector and find its magnitude.

2. A fishing boat in Sekondi-Takoradi experiences a current force of 250 N acting 45° south of west and a wind force of 180 N acting 60° north of west. Find the resultant force acting on the boat.

3. A farmer in Koforidua sells 50 kg of cocoa beans for GH₵400 and 30 kg of coffee beans for GH₵270. Represent the total weight and total revenue as a vector.

Answers:
1. $\vec{d} = (−300, −500)$ m, $|\vec{d}| = 583.1$ m
2. $\vec{F_r} = (−303.2, −106.1)$ N, $|\vec{F_r}| = 321.1$ N
3. $\vec{s} = (80, 670)$
