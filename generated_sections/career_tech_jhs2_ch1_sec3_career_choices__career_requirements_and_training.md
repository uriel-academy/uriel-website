### Exploring Your Interests and Skills
The first step in choosing a career is to think about what you enjoy doing and what you're good at. Consider your hobbies, favorite subjects in school, and activities that make you feel proud and accomplished. Here are some questions to ask yourself:

- What do I like to do in my free time?
- What subjects do I excel in at school?
- What tasks come easily to me?
- What do people often compliment me on?

Make a list of your interests and skills, and think about how they could translate into different careers. For example:

- Vocational training or apprenticeships
- Specific skills or knowledge
- Work experience

You can find information on career requirements from various sources:
- Online research (job websites, government resources)
- Talking to people who work in the field

Make a table of the careers you're interested in and their requirements:

| Carpenter | Vocational training or apprenticeship | On-the-job training | Woodworking, measuring, using power tools safely |

### Creating a Career Plan
Now that you know what your career goals are and what you need to achieve them, it's time to make a plan! Break down your long-term goal into smaller, manageable steps. Consider:

- Short-term goals (1-2 years): Building relevant skills, getting good grades, finding internships or part-time jobs
- Medium-term goals (3-5 years): Completing education or training, gaining work experience, saving money
- Long-term goals (5+ years): Landing your dream job, starting your own business, advancing in your career

Write down your goals and the steps you'll take to achieve them. For example:

Long-term goal: Become a successful fashion designer

1. Research fashion design courses and schools
2. Develop sewing and sketching skills through practice and classes
3. Complete SHS with good grades, especially in art and home economics
4. Apply to fashion design diploma or degree programs
5. Gain experience through internships or assisting local tailors
6. Create a portfolio of designs and apply for jobs at fashion houses
7. Eventually, start my own fashion label specializing in modern African wear

Remember, your career plan is a guide, not a strict rulebook. Be open to new opportunities and adjust your plan as needed. The most important thing is to keep working towards your goals and believing in yourself!
