## Introduction
In our daily lives, we often encounter situations that involve measuring the amount of space an object occupies or the quantity of a substance that a container can hold. These concepts are known as volume and capacity. Understanding volume and capacity is crucial for many real-life applications, such as calculating the amount of cement needed to build a house, determining the quantity of water a tank can store, or estimating the volume of crops harvested from a farm. In this lesson, we will explore the concepts of volume and capacity, learn how to calculate them using formulas, and apply this knowledge to solve problems in the context of Ghanaian life. Mastering these skills will not only help you in your everyday life but also prepare you for the BECE examination.

## Main Content
### Volume
**Volume** is the amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional object. It is measured in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm³), cubic meters (m³), or cubic inches (in³). To calculate the volume of an object, we multiply its length, width, and height.

#### Volume of a Cube
A **cube** is a three-dimensional object with all its sides equal in length. The formula for the volume of a cube is:

$V = s^3$

where $V$ is the volume and $s$ is the length of one side of the cube.

#### Volume of a Cuboid
A **cuboid** is a three-dimensional object with rectangular faces. The formula for the volume of a cuboid is:

$V = l \times w \times h$

where $V$ is the volume, $l$ is the length, $w$ is the width, and $h$ is the height of the cuboid.

#### Volume of a Cylinder
A **cylinder** is a three-dimensional object with two identical circular bases connected by a curved surface. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:

$V = \pi r^2 h$

where $V$ is the volume, $\pi$ (pi) is approximately 3.14159, $r$ is the radius of the circular base, and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.

| Shape   | Volume Formula    |
|---------|-------------------|
| Cube    | $V = s^3$         |
| Cuboid  | $V = l \times w \times h$ |
| Cylinder| $V = \pi r^2 h$   |

### Capacity
**Capacity** is the maximum amount of substance that a container can hold. It is often measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). One liter is equal to 1,000 milliliters or 1,000 cubic centimeters.

| Unit         | Equivalent        |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 liter (L)  | 1,000 milliliters (mL) |
| 1 liter (L)  | 1,000 cubic centimeters (cm³) |

### Converting Units
To convert between different units of volume and capacity, we can use the following conversion factors:

- 1 m³ = 1,000 L
- 1 L = 1,000 mL
- 1 L = 1,000 cm³

To convert from one unit to another, multiply or divide by the appropriate conversion factor.

### Problem-Solving Steps
When solving problems involving volume and capacity, follow these steps:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the unknown quantity
2. Determine the appropriate formula to use based on the shape of the object or container
3. Substitute the given values into the formula and calculate the result
4. If necessary, convert the result to the desired unit of measurement
5. Check your answer for reasonableness and ensure that it is properly labeled with the correct unit

## Worked Examples
1. A rectangular water tank has a length of 2 meters, a width of 1.5 meters, and a height of 1 meter. Calculate the volume of the tank in liters.

Given: 
- Length (l) = 2 m
- Width (w) = 1.5 m
- Height (h) = 1 m

Step 1: Determine the formula for the volume of a cuboid
$V = l \times w \times h$

Step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula
$V = 2 \text{ m} \times 1.5 \text{ m} \times 1 \text{ m} = 3 \text{ m}^3$

Step 3: Convert cubic meters to liters
$3 \text{ m}^3 = 3 \times 1,000 \text{ L} = 3,000 \text{ L}$

Therefore, the volume of the water tank is 3,000 liters.

2. A cylindrical oil drum has a radius of 20 cm and a height of 1.2 meters. Calculate the volume of the drum in liters.

[IMAGE: A diagram of a cylindrical oil drum with labels for radius (r) and height (h)]

Given:
- Radius (r) = 20 cm = 0.2 m
- Height (h) = 1.2 m

Step 1: Determine the formula for the volume of a cylinder
$V = \pi r^2 h$

Step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula
$V = 3.14159 \times (0.2 \text{ m})^2 \times 1.2 \text{ m} \approx 0.15 \text{ m}^3$

Step 3: Convert cubic meters to liters
$0.15 \text{ m}^3 = 0.15 \times 1,000 \text{ L} = 150 \text{ L}$

Therefore, the volume of the oil drum is approximately 150 liters.

3. A farmer harvests cocoa beans and fills a cuboid-shaped container with a length of 1.5 meters, a width of 1 meter, and a height of 80 cm. If the farmer fills 12 such containers, what is the total volume of cocoa beans harvested in liters?

Given:
- Length (l) = 1.5 m
- Width (w) = 1 m
- Height (h) = 80 cm = 0.8 m
- Number of containers = 12

Step 1: Determine the formula for the volume of a cuboid
$V = l \times w \times h$

Step 2: Calculate the volume of one container
$V = 1.5 \text{ m} \times 1 \text{ m} \times 0.8 \text{ m} = 1.2 \text{ m}^3$

Step 3: Convert cubic meters to liters
$1.2 \text{ m}^3 = 1.2 \times 1,000 \text{ L} = 1,200 \text{ L}$

Step 4: Calculate the total volume of cocoa beans in 12 containers
$\text{Total volume} = 1,200 \text{ L} \times 12 = 14,400 \text{ L}$

Therefore, the total volume of cocoa beans harvested is 14,400 liters.
