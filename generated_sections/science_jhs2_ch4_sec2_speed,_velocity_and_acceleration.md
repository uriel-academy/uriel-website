## Introduction
In our daily lives in Ghana, we experience motion all around us. From the swift flow of the mighty Volta River to the steady movement of cocoa beans on a conveyor belt at a processing factory, understanding the concepts of speed, velocity, and acceleration is crucial. These concepts not only help us describe and quantify motion but also form the foundation for understanding more complex phenomena in physics and engineering, such as the operation of the hydroelectric dam at Akosombo.

As JHS 2 students, learning about speed, velocity, and acceleration will enhance your understanding of the world around you and provide a solid foundation for future studies in science and technology. By mastering these concepts, you will be better equipped to tackle real-world problems and contribute to Ghana's development in various fields, such as agriculture, transportation, and energy production.

## Main Content
### Speed
**Speed** is the rate at which an object covers a certain distance in a given amount of time. It is a scalar quantity, meaning it only has magnitude and no specific direction. The formula for calculating speed is:

Speed = Distance ÷ Time

Or, using symbols:
v = d ÷ t, where v is speed, d is distance, and t is time.

In SI units, speed is measured in meters per second (m/s).

For example, if a cocoa farmer in Ghana walks 2 kilometers in 30 minutes, their speed can be calculated as follows:
Speed = 2 km ÷ 0.5 h = 4 km/h

### Velocity
**Velocity** is similar to speed, but it also includes the direction of motion. Velocity is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. The formula for calculating velocity is the same as speed, but the direction must be specified:

Velocity = Distance ÷ Time (with direction)

In SI units, velocity is also measured in meters per second (m/s).

For example, if a boat travels 10 kilometers eastward on the Volta River in 2 hours, its velocity can be expressed as:
Velocity = 10 km ÷ 2 h = 5 km/h eastward

### Acceleration
**Acceleration** is the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time. It is also a vector quantity, as it has both magnitude and direction. The formula for calculating acceleration is:

Acceleration = Change in velocity ÷ Time

Or, using symbols:
a = (v_f - v_i) ÷ t, where a is acceleration, v_f is final velocity, v_i is initial velocity, and t is time.

In SI units, acceleration is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²).

For example, if a car in Accra starts from rest and reaches a velocity of 20 m/s in 5 seconds, its acceleration can be calculated as follows:
Acceleration = (20 m/s - 0 m/s) ÷ 5 s = 4 m/s²

### Relationship between Acceleration, Force, and Mass
According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This relationship is expressed by the equation:

F = ma

Where F is the net force (in newtons, N), m is the mass (in kilograms, kg), and a is the acceleration (in m/s²).

## Worked Examples
1. A cheetah, the fastest land animal, can reach a speed of 120 km/h. If a cheetah maintains this speed for 30 seconds, how far will it travel?
   * Given:
     * Speed (v) = 120 km/h = 33.33 m/s
     * Time (t) = 30 s
   * Distance (d) = Speed (v) × Time (t)
   * d = 33.33 m/s × 30 s = 1000 m or 1 km

2. A ball is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 20 m/s. If the acceleration due to gravity is -9.8 m/s², what will be the ball's velocity after 3 seconds?
   * Given:
     * Initial velocity (v_i) = 20 m/s
     * Acceleration (a) = -9.8 m/s²
     * Time (t) = 3 s
   * Final velocity (v_f) = Initial velocity (v_i) + Acceleration (a) × Time (t)
   * v_f = 20 m/s + (-9.8 m/s²) × 3 s = -9.4 m/s

## Summary
- Speed is the rate at which an object covers a distance in a given time, while velocity is speed with a specified direction.
- Acceleration is the rate at which an object's velocity changes over time.
- The formula for speed and velocity is: Speed or Velocity = Distance ÷ Time
- The formula for acceleration is: Acceleration = Change in velocity ÷ Time
- Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass, expressed as F = ma.
