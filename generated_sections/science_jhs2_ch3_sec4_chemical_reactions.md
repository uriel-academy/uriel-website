## Learning Objectives
1. Define and explain what a chemical reaction is.
2. Identify the different types of chemical reactions.
3. Balance simple chemical equations.
4. Understand the importance of chemical reactions in everyday life, such as in cocoa farming and water treatment.
5. Perform a simple experiment to demonstrate a chemical reaction using local materials.

## Introduction
Chemical reactions are an essential part of our daily lives in Ghana. From the fermentation of cocoa beans during the processing of cocoa to the treatment of water at the Kpong Water Treatment Plant near the Akosombo Dam, chemical reactions play a crucial role. They also occur within our bodies, such as the digestion of fufu or banku, and in the environment around us, like the rusting of iron roofing sheets. Understanding chemical reactions helps us to better appreciate the world we live in and to solve problems we face, such as treating diseases like malaria or improving crop yields. In this section, we will explore what chemical reactions are, their different types, and their significance in our everyday lives.

## Main Content
### What is a Chemical Reaction?
A **chemical reaction** is a process in which one or more substances, called **reactants**, are converted into one or more different substances, called **products**. During a chemical reaction, the atoms that make up the reactants are rearranged to form new substances. The total number of atoms remains the same, but the way they are combined changes.

### Types of Chemical Reactions
There are several types of chemical reactions, including:
1. **Synthesis reactions**: Two or more reactants combine to form a single product. 
   - Example: 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)
2. **Decomposition reactions**: A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances.
   - Example: 2H₂O(l) → 2H₂(g) + O₂(g)
3. **Single displacement reactions**: A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element in a compound.
   - Example: Zn(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + Cu(s)
4. **Double displacement reactions**: Two compounds swap partners to form two new compounds.
   - Example: NaCl(aq) + AgNO₃(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)

### Balancing Chemical Equations
In a chemical equation, the number of atoms of each element in the reactants must equal the number of atoms of each element in the products. To balance a chemical equation, coefficients (numbers) are added in front of the chemical formulas until the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow.

For example, in the synthesis of water:
- Unbalanced: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O
- Balanced: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

### Practical Example: Rusting of Iron
The rusting of iron is a common chemical reaction in Ghana, especially in coastal areas due to the humid climate. This reaction involves iron (Fe), oxygen (O₂), and water (H₂O).

Rusting reaction: 4Fe(s) + 3O₂(g) + 6H₂O(l) → 4Fe(OH)₃(s)

To demonstrate this reaction, you can:
1. Collect some iron nails or steel wool.
2. Wet the nails or steel wool with water.
3. Leave them exposed to air for several days.
4. Observe the formation of rust (iron(III) hydroxide) on the surface.

## Worked Examples
1. Balance the following chemical equation:
   - CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
   - Solution: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O

2. Identify the type of reaction:
   - 2NaHCO₃(s) → Na₂CO₃(s) + CO₂(g) + H₂O(g)
   - Solution: This is a decomposition reaction because one compound (NaHCO₃) breaks down into simpler substances (Na₂CO₃, CO₂, and H₂O).

## Summary
- Chemical reactions involve the rearrangement of atoms to form new substances.
- The total number of atoms remains the same during a chemical reaction.
- The four main types of chemical reactions are synthesis, decomposition, single displacement, and double displacement.
- Chemical equations must be balanced so that the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow.
- Chemical reactions are essential in everyday life, such as in cocoa farming, water treatment, and the rusting of iron.
