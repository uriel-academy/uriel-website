## Introduction
Electricity plays a crucial role in our daily lives, from powering the lights in our homes to running the machines that process cocoa beans on Ghanaian farms. The Akosombo Dam on the Volta River generates hydroelectric power, supplying electricity to millions of people in Ghana. Understanding how electricity works and how to build and maintain electric circuits is essential for students who want to contribute to Ghana's growing economy and technological development.

In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts of electric circuits, including current, voltage, and resistance. We will also learn about the basic components of electric circuits and how to construct simple series and parallel circuits using local materials. By the end of this section, you will have a solid foundation in the principles of electricity and be able to apply this knowledge to real-world situations in Ghana.

## Main Content

### 1. Current, Voltage, and Resistance
In an electric circuit, **current** is the flow of electric charge, typically carried by electrons. Current is measured in **amperes (A)** and is represented by the symbol **I**. **Voltage**, also known as electrical potential difference, is the force that drives current through a circuit. It is measured in **volts (V)** and is represented by the symbol **V**. **Resistance** is the opposition to the flow of current in a circuit, and it is measured in **ohms (Ω)**. Resistance is represented by the symbol **R**.

### 2. Ohm's Law
The relationship between current, voltage, and resistance is described by **Ohm's Law**, which states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor. Mathematically, Ohm's Law is expressed as:

V = I × R

where V is the voltage in volts, I is the current in amperes, and R is the resistance in ohms.

### 3. Basic Components of Electric Circuits
Electric circuits consist of several basic components, including:
- **Power source**: A device that provides electrical energy to the circuit, such as a battery or a generator (e.g., the Akosombo Dam).
- **Conductors**: Materials that allow electric current to flow easily, such as copper wires.
- **Resistors**: Components that oppose the flow of current, such as light bulbs or heating elements.
- **Switches**: Devices that can open or close a circuit, controlling the flow of current.

### 4. Series and Parallel Circuits
Electric circuits can be arranged in two basic configurations: series and parallel. In a **series circuit**, the components are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for the current to flow. In a **parallel circuit**, the components are connected side-by-side, creating multiple paths for the current to flow.

Practical example: Constructing a simple series circuit using local materials
Materials needed:
- 2 D-cell batteries
- 2 flashlight bulbs
- Insulated copper wire
- Scissors
- Tape

Procedure:
1. Cut two 20 cm lengths of insulated copper wire.
2. Strip about 1 cm of insulation from each end of the wires.
3. Connect one end of the first wire to the positive terminal of one battery.
4. Connect the other end of the first wire to the positive terminal of one flashlight bulb.
5. Connect one end of the second wire to the negative terminal of the flashlight bulb.
6. Connect the other end of the second wire to the positive terminal of the second flashlight bulb.
7. Connect the negative terminal of the second flashlight bulb to the negative terminal of the second battery.
8. Tape the batteries together, ensuring the terminals do not touch each other.
9. Observe the brightness of the bulbs in the series circuit.

## Worked Examples

Example 1: Calculating current using Ohm's Law
A 9 V battery is connected to a 3 Ω resistor. Calculate the current flowing through the resistor.

Solution:
Using Ohm's Law: V = I × R
Rearranging the equation to solve for I: I = V ÷ R
Substituting the given values: I = 9 V ÷ 3 Ω = 3 A
Therefore, the current flowing through the resistor is 3 A.

Example 2: Calculating voltage using Ohm's Law
A current of 0.5 A flows through a 120 Ω resistor. Calculate the voltage across the resistor.

Solution:
Using Ohm's Law: V = I × R
Substituting the given values: V = 0.5 A × 120 Ω = 60 V
Therefore, the voltage across the resistor is 60 V.

## Summary
- Current is the flow of electric charge, voltage is the force that drives current, and resistance is the opposition to current flow.
- Ohm's Law describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance: V = I × R.
- Basic components of electric circuits include power sources, conductors, resistors, and switches.
- Series circuits have components connected end-to-end, while parallel circuits have components connected side-by-side.
- Ohm's Law can be used to calculate current, voltage, or resistance in an electric circuit when the other two quantities are known.
