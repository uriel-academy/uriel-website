## Introduction
Linear equations are a fundamental concept in algebra and have numerous applications in daily life. In Ghana, we encounter linear equations in various situations, such as calculating the cost of items in the market, determining the amount of money needed for a mobile money transaction, or estimating the yield of a farm based on the number of crops planted. Understanding linear equations is also crucial for success in the BECE mathematics exam, as it forms a significant portion of the syllabus.

As Ghanaian students, it is essential to master the skills of forming and solving linear equations to solve problems efficiently in both academic and real-life situations. By the end of this section, you will be equipped with the knowledge and techniques needed to tackle linear equations with confidence.

## Main Content
### Components of a Linear Equation
A linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form **ax + b = c**, where **a**, **b**, and **c** are real numbers and **a ≠ 0**. In this equation:
- **a** is the coefficient of the variable **x**
- **b** is the constant term
- **c** is the value on the right-hand side of the equation

For example, in the equation **3x + 7 = 19**, we have:
- a = 3
- b = 7
- c = 19

### Solving Linear Equations using Properties of Equality
To solve a linear equation, we use the following properties of equality:
1. Addition Property of Equality: If **a = b**, then **a + c = b + c** for any real number **c**.
2. Multiplication Property of Equality: If **a = b**, then **ac = bc** for any non-zero real number **c**.

These properties allow us to perform operations on both sides of an equation without changing the equality.

### Step-by-Step Procedure for Solving Linear Equations
To solve a linear equation:
1. Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms.
2. Use the addition property of equality to isolate the variable term on one side of the equation.
3. Use the multiplication property of equality to make the coefficient of the variable term equal to 1.
4. Simplify the equation to find the solution for the variable.

| Property                    | Equation    | Operation                                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Addition Property           | a + c = b + c | Add the same value to both sides                  |
| Multiplication Property     | ac = bc       | Multiply both sides by the same non-zero value    |

### Translating Word Problems into Linear Equations
Many real-life problems can be solved using linear equations. To translate a word problem into a linear equation:
1. Identify the unknown quantity and represent it with a variable (e.g., x).
2. Write an equation that represents the relationship between the known and unknown quantities.
3. Solve the equation to find the value of the unknown quantity.

## Worked Examples
1. Solve for x: 4x - 7 = 9
   Step 1: Add 7 to both sides of the equation
   4x - 7 + 7 = 9 + 7
   4x = 16

   Step 2: Divide both sides by 4
   4x ÷ 4 = 16 ÷ 4
   x = 4

   Therefore, the solution is x = 4.

2. Kofi has GH₵150 in his mobile money account. He sends GH₵50 to his brother and receives GH₵30 from his sister. If he spends GH₵20 on airtime, how much money does Kofi have left in his account?
   Let x be the amount of money Kofi has left in his account.
   Initial amount: GH₵150
   Amount sent: GH₵50
   Amount received: GH₵30
   Amount spent on airtime: GH₵20

   Equation: 150 - 50 + 30 - 20 = x
   Simplify: 110 = x

   Therefore, Kofi has GH₵110 left in his mobile money account.

3. A farmer planted 120 cassava plants and 90 yam plants. Each cassava plant yields 5 tubers, and each yam plant yields 3 tubers. How many tubers will the farmer harvest in total?
   Let x be the total number of tubers harvested.
   Number of cassava plants: 120
   Yield per cassava plant: 5 tubers
   Number of yam plants: 90
   Yield per yam plant: 3 tubers

   Equation: 120 × 5 + 90 × 3 = x
   Simplify: 600 + 270 = x
             870 = x

   Therefore, the farmer will harvest a total of 870 tubers.

## Practice Problems
1. Solve for x: 2(3x - 5) = 4(2x + 1)
2. Ama bought 3 pens and 2 notebooks for GH₵11. If each pen costs GH₵2, find the cost of each notebook.
3. A rectangle has a length that is 4 units more than its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 40 units, find its length and width.

(Answers: 1. x = 3; 2. Each notebook costs GH₵2.50; 3. Length = 12 units, Width = 8 units)
