## Introduction
Geometry and mensuration are essential branches of mathematics that have numerous applications in everyday life. In Ghana, understanding how to calculate areas is crucial for various situations, such as determining the size of a farm plot, calculating the amount of fabric needed for a dress, or estimating the cost of flooring for a room. Mensuration skills are also vital for success in the BECE and WAEC exams, as these topics are frequently tested. By mastering the concepts of area calculation, students can develop problem-solving skills and apply mathematical knowledge to real-life scenarios, such as managing personal finances through mobile money or making accurate measurements in the market.

## Main Content
### Types of Plane Shapes
Plane shapes are two-dimensional figures that lie on a flat surface. Common plane shapes include:
- **Rectangles**: Four-sided shapes with opposite sides parallel and equal, and all angles measuring 90°.
- **Squares**: Special rectangles with all sides equal in length.
- **Parallelograms**: Four-sided shapes with opposite sides parallel and equal.
- **Triangles**: Three-sided shapes with three angles.
- **Circles**: Round shapes with all points equidistant from the center.

### Area Formulas
To calculate the area of plane shapes, use the following formulas:

| Shape         | Area Formula          |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Rectangle     | A = length × width   |
| Square        | A = side × side      |
| Parallelogram | A = base × height    |
| Triangle      | A = $\frac{1}{2}$ × base × height |
| Circle        | A = π × radius²      |

Note: π (Pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

### Calculating Areas Step-by-Step
To find the area of a plane shape, follow these steps:
1. Identify the shape and its dimensions.
2. Select the appropriate formula for the shape.
3. Substitute the given dimensions into the formula.
4. Perform the calculation and simplify if needed.
5. Include the correct unit of measurement (e.g., cm², m², km²).

### Applications of Area Calculations

Area calculations have numerous applications in daily life, including:
- Determining the amount of material needed for construction projects
- Calculating the size of land plots for farming or real estate
- Estimating the cost of flooring, wallpaper, or paint for a room
- Designing clothing patterns and determining fabric requirements

## Worked Examples
1. A rectangular room measures 5 meters long and 3 meters wide. Calculate its area.
   - Formula: A = length × width
   - Dimensions: length = 5 m, width = 3 m
   - Calculation: A = 5 m × 3 m = 15 m²
   Therefore, the area of the room is 15 square meters.

2. A circular table has a diameter of 1.2 meters. Find its area.
   - Formula: A = π × radius²
   - Diameter = 1.2 m, so radius = 1.2 m ÷ 2 = 0.6 m
   - Calculation: A = 3.14159 × (0.6 m)² ≈ 1.13 m²
   The area of the circular table is approximately 1.13 square meters.

3. A triangular piece of land has a base of 20 meters and a height of 12 meters. What is its area?
   [IMAGE: Diagram of a triangular piece of land with base and height labeled]
   - Formula: A = $\frac{1}{2}$ × base × height
   - Dimensions: base = 20 m, height = 12 m
   - Calculation: A = $\frac{1}{2}$ × 20 m × 12 m = 120 m²
   The triangular piece of land has an area of 120 square meters.

## Practice Problems
1. A square-shaped room has a side length of 4.5 meters. Calculate its area.
2. A parallelogram-shaped garden has a base of 6 meters and a height of 3 meters. What is its area?
3. A circular pizza has a radius of 15 centimeters. Find its area.

Answers:
1. 20.25 m²
2. 18 m²
3. 706.86 cm² (rounded to 2 decimal places)
