1. Separate white clothes from colored ones
2. Group colors into light and dark piles
3. Separate delicate fabrics (e.g., silk, lace) from sturdier ones (e.g., cotton, denim)
4. Check care labels for specific instructions

### Handwashing Techniques
In Ghana, many households rely on handwashing for their laundry needs. Here's how to effectively handwash your clothes:

Materials:
- Basin or large bucket
- Mild detergent (e.g., Sunlight, Omo)
- Water

Steps:
1. Fill the basin with water and add a small amount of detergent
2. Submerge the clothes in the soapy water and gently scrub them
3. Pay extra attention to heavily soiled areas, such as collars and cuffs
4. Rinse the clothes thoroughly in clean water until all soap is removed
5. Gently squeeze out excess water (avoid wringing, which can damage fabrics)

|-------|----------------|
| Palm oil | Scrub with soap and hot water, then soak in a mixture of water and washing soda |
| Red clay | Brush off excess dirt, then soak in a mixture of water and white vinegar |
| Fruit juice | Blot with a clean cloth, then apply a paste of baking soda and water |

### Drying and Folding
Proper drying and folding techniques help preserve the shape and quality of your clothes.

Drying:
- Hang clothes on a clothesline or drying rack in a sunny, breezy area
- Avoid direct sunlight for dark colors and delicate fabrics to prevent fading
- Use clothespins to secure items and prevent them from blowing away

Folding:
- Fold clothes while they are still slightly damp to minimize wrinkles
- Use a flat surface, like a table or bed, for neat folding
- Store folded clothes in a clean, dry place to prevent mildew
