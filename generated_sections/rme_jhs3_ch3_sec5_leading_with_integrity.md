## Introduction
Kofi and Ama listened intently as their RME teacher, Mr. Mensah, began the day's lesson. "Today, we will be learning about a critical aspect of leadership - leading with integrity," he said. The students knew this was an important topic, as they had seen both good and bad examples of leadership in their communities, from the churches and mosques of Accra and Kumasi to the chiefs' palaces in their hometowns.

Mr. Mensah continued, "As future leaders of Ghana, it is essential that you understand what it means to lead with integrity. Whether you aspire to be a political leader, a religious leader, or a leader in your profession, integrity is a non-negotiable quality that will set you apart and enable you to make a positive impact on your community and nation."
