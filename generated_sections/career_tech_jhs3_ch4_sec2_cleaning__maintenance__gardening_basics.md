### Preparing the Soil
Healthy soil is crucial for a successful garden. Follow these steps to prepare your soil:

1. Clear the land of weeds, rocks, and debris using a cutlass and rake.
2. Loosen the soil to a depth of 20-30 cm using a hoe. This allows roots to grow easily and improves drainage.
3. Mix in organic matter, such as compost, well-rotted manure, or shredded leaves, to enrich the soil with nutrients.
4. Level the soil with a rake and create rows or mounds for planting.

### Planting and Caring for Common Ghanaian Vegetables and Herbs
Ghana has a diverse range of vegetables and herbs that thrive in its climate. Some popular choices include:

| Vegetable/Herb | Planting Method | Care |
|----------------|-----------------|------|
| Okra | Sow seeds directly in mounds, 60 cm apart | Water regularly, harvest pods when 7-10 cm long |
| Pepper | Transplant seedlings 50 cm apart | Stake plants, water regularly, harvest when fruits are mature |
| Tomato | Transplant seedlings 60 cm apart | Stake plants, water consistently, remove side shoots |
| Basil | Sow seeds directly or transplant seedlings 20 cm apart | Water regularly, pinch off flower buds to encourage leaf growth |

### Eco-Friendly Pest Control
To protect your garden from pests while minimizing the use of harmful chemicals, try these eco-friendly methods:

- Companion planting: Grow plants like marigolds, onions, and garlic near your vegetables to repel pests.
- Neem oil: Mix neem oil with water and spray on plants to control pests like aphids and whiteflies.
- Handpicking: Regularly inspect your plants and remove pests by hand.
- Chili pepper spray: Blend chili peppers with water and spray on plants to deter pests.
