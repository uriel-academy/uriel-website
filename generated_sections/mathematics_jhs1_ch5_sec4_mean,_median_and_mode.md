## Learning Objectives
After completing this section, students will be able to:
1. Calculate the mean of a set of numbers

## Introduction
Statistics play a crucial role in our daily lives as Ghanaians. From calculating the average price of goods at the market to analyzing mobile money transaction data, understanding statistical measures is essential. For farmers, statistics help in estimating crop yields and making informed decisions. As you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering the concepts of mean, median, and mode will not only boost your mathematical skills but also enable you to solve real-world problems effectively.

In this section, we will explore these three measures of central tendency in detail. We will learn how to calculate them, interpret their meanings, and apply them to various scenarios. By the end of this section, you will have a solid foundation in statistics that will serve you well in your future studies and beyond.

## Main Content
### Mean
The **mean** is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the total number of values. The formula for the mean is:

$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$

where $\bar{x}$ is the mean, $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ represents the sum of all values, and $n$ is the total number of values.

To calculate the mean:
1. Add up all the values in the dataset
2. Divide the sum by the total number of values

For example, to find the mean of the numbers 4, 7, 9, and 12:
1. Add the numbers: 4 + 7 + 9 + 12 = 32
2. Divide by the total count: 32 ÷ 4 = 8

Therefore, the mean is 8.

### Median
The **median** is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

To find the median:
1. Arrange the values in ascending or descending order
2. If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle value
3. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle values

For example, to find the median of the numbers 4, 7, 9, and 12:
1. Arrange in ascending order: 4, 7, 9, 12
2. There are 4 values (even), so the median is the average of the two middle values (7 and 9)
   - Median = (7 + 9) ÷ 2 = 8

Therefore, the median is 8.

### Mode
The **mode** is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes.

To determine the mode:
1. Identify the value or values that occur most often in the dataset
2. If no value appears more than once, there is no mode
3. If two or more values appear with the same highest frequency, they are all modes

For example, in the dataset 4, 7, 9, 12, 7, each value appears once except for 7, which appears twice. Therefore, the mode is 7.

### Comparing Mean, Median, and Mode

The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency, but they provide different information about a dataset:
- The mean is affected by extreme values and is a good representation of the dataset when the data is symmetrically distributed
- The median is less affected by extreme values and is a better measure when the data is skewed
- The mode represents the most common value and is useful for categorical or discrete data

## Worked Examples
1. The weights (in kg) of 5 bags of rice at a market are: 50, 52, 48, 51, 49. Calculate the mean weight.

Solution:
- Sum of weights = 50 + 52 + 48 + 51 + 49 = 250
- Number of bags = 5
- Mean weight = 250 ÷ 5 = 50 kg

Therefore, the mean weight of the rice bags is 50 kg.

2. The monthly mobile money transactions (in GH₵) for a small business are: 150, 200, 175, 225, 180, 190. Find the median transaction amount.

Solution:
- Arrange the values in ascending order: 150, 175, 180, 190, 200, 225
- There are 6 values (even), so the median is the average of the two middle values (180 and 190)
- Median = (180 + 190) ÷ 2 = 185

Therefore, the median monthly transaction amount is GH₵185.

3. The number of mangoes harvested from 10 trees in a farmer's orchard are: 25, 30, 28, 30, 32, 27, 29, 30, 31, 28. Determine the mode of the dataset.

Solution:
- The value that appears most frequently is 30, appearing 3 times
- No other value appears more than twice

Therefore, the mode of the mango harvest dataset is 30.

## Practice Problems
1. The scores of 7 students on a BECE practice test are: 75, 80, 85, 90, 78, 82, 88. Calculate the mean score.

2. The daily sales (in GH₵) at a market stall for a week are: 120, 150, 130, 140, 160, 145, 135. Find the median daily sales.

3. The number of eggs laid by 12 chickens in a day are: 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 3, 4, 6, 5, 4, 5, 4. Determine the mode of the dataset.

Answers:
1. 82.57
2. GH₵140
3. 4 and 5 (bimodal)

## Summary
- The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated by dividing the sum of all values by the total number of values
- The median is the middle value in a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order
- The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset
- The mean is affected by extreme values, while the median is less affected and is a better measure for skewed data
