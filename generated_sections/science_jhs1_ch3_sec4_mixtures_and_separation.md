## Introduction
In our daily lives, we encounter various substances, from the air we breathe to the food we eat. Many of these substances are mixtures, combining two or more pure substances. In Ghana, mixtures play a crucial role in various aspects of life. For example, in cocoa farming, which is a major agricultural activity in Ghana, the harvested cocoa beans are a mixture of the beans, husks, and other impurities. To obtain pure cocoa beans, farmers must separate this mixture. Similarly, at the Akosombo Dam, which generates hydroelectric power for Ghana, the water used is a mixture of pure water and dissolved minerals. Understanding mixtures and their separation methods is essential for students to appreciate the science behind these everyday examples.

## Main Content
### Pure Substances and Mixtures
In chemistry, we classify matter into two main categories: pure substances and mixtures. A **pure substance** is a material that has a fixed composition and distinct properties. Examples of pure substances include elements like gold (Au), and compounds such as water (H2O) and salt (NaCl). On the other hand, a **mixture** is a combination of two or more pure substances in which each substance retains its individual properties. The components of a mixture can be separated using physical methods.

### Types of Mixtures
Mixtures can be further classified into two types:
1. **Homogeneous mixtures**: Also known as solutions, these mixtures have a uniform composition throughout. The components are evenly distributed, and the mixture appears as a single phase. Examples include salt water, air, and brass (an alloy of copper and zinc).
2. **Heterogeneous mixtures**: These mixtures have a non-uniform composition, and the components are not evenly distributed. The mixture appears to have multiple phases. Examples include a mixture of sand and water, a salad, and a mixture of oil and water.

| Type of Mixture | Definition | Examples |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| Homogeneous     | Uniform composition, single phase | Salt water, air, brass |
| Heterogeneous   | Non-uniform composition, multiple phases | Sand and water, salad, oil and water |

### Separation of Mixtures
Mixtures can be separated into their individual components using various physical methods. The choice of the separation method depends on the properties of the components and the type of mixture. Some common separation methods include:
- **Filtration**: This method is used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid. The mixture is passed through a filter paper, which retains the solid particles while allowing the liquid to pass through. For example, when preparing palm oil, the mixture of palm fruit pulp and oil is filtered to obtain pure palm oil.
- **Evaporation**: This method is used to separate a soluble solid from a liquid. The mixture is heated, causing the liquid to evaporate and leaving behind the solid residue. For example, salt can be obtained from salt water by evaporating the water.
- **Distillation**: This method is used to separate a liquid mixture based on the differences in the boiling points of the components. The mixture is heated, and the vapors are collected and condensed back into a liquid. For example, distillation can be used to separate a mixture of water and alcohol.
- **Chromatography**: This method is used to separate a mixture of soluble substances based on their interaction with a stationary phase (such as paper) and a mobile phase (such as water). As the mobile phase moves through the stationary phase, the components of the mixture are separated based on their affinity for the two phases. For example, chromatography can be used to separate a mixture of different plant pigments.

### Experiment: Separating a Mixture of Sand and Salt
You can perform a simple experiment to separate a mixture of sand and salt using local materials. You will need:
- A mixture of sand and salt
- A filter paper or a clean piece of cloth
- A funnel or a plastic bottle with the bottom cut off
- A beaker or a bowl
- Water

Procedure:
1. Place the filter paper or cloth in the funnel or the cut plastic bottle.
2. Pour the mixture of sand and salt onto the filter paper.
3. Gently pour water over the mixture. The water will dissolve the salt and carry it through the filter paper, while the sand will be retained on the filter paper.
4. Collect the salt water in the beaker or bowl.
5. Heat the salt water until the water evaporates, leaving behind the salt.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the mass percentage of salt in a 50 g mixture containing 10 g of salt.
   - Mass of salt = 10 g
   - Total mass of the mixture = 50 g
   - Mass percentage of salt = (Mass of salt / Total mass of the mixture) × 100
   - Mass percentage of salt = (10 g / 50 g) × 100 = 20%

2. A student has a 100 mL mixture of water and ethanol. If the mixture contains 40 mL of ethanol, what is the volume percentage of water in the mixture?
   - Total volume of the mixture = 100 mL
   - Volume of ethanol = 40 mL
   - Volume of water = Total volume - Volume of ethanol = 100 mL - 40 mL = 60 mL
   - Volume percentage of water = (Volume of water / Total volume of the mixture) × 100
   - Volume percentage of water = (60 mL / 100 mL) × 100 = 60%

## Summary
- Matter can be classified into pure substances and mixtures.
- Pure substances have a fixed composition and distinct properties, while mixtures are combinations of two or more pure substances.
- Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform composition) or heterogeneous (non-uniform composition).
- Mixtures can be separated using various physical methods, such as filtration, evaporation, distillation, and chromatography.
- The choice of the separation method depends on the properties of the components and the type of mixture.
- Mixture separation has numerous applications in everyday life and industries in Ghana, such as in cocoa farming and palm oil production.
