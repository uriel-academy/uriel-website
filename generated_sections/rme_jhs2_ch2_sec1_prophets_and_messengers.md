## Main Content
### The Role of Prophets and Messengers
Prophets and messengers are individuals who are believed to have been chosen by God or a divine power to convey messages and teachings to humanity. In Christianity, Islam, and ATR, prophets and messengers have played a significant role in spreading religious beliefs, guiding people towards righteousness, and establishing moral and ethical codes.

### Key Prophets and Messengers in Christianity, Islam, and ATR
- **Christianity**: Jesus Christ, considered the central figure and the Son of God, taught about love, forgiveness, and salvation. Other notable prophets include Moses, who led the Israelites out of Egypt and received the Ten Commandments, and Noah, who built the ark and saved humanity from the great flood.

- **Islam**: Muhammad, the final prophet in Islam, received revelations from Allah and preached about submission to God, compassion, and equality. Other prophets recognized in Islam include Abraham, who is seen as the father of monotheism, and Jesus, who is revered as a prophet but not as the Son of God.

- **African Traditional Religion**: In ATR, there are various spiritual leaders, such as priests, priestesses, and diviners, who communicate with the gods, ancestors, and spirits on behalf of their communities. These leaders offer guidance, healing, and protection and help maintain the balance between the physical and spiritual worlds.
