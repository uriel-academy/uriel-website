### Preparing a Ghanaian Soup or Stew
Soups and stews are central to Ghanaian cuisine. While recipes vary between regions and families, most follow a basic formula of a protein, vegetables, and a starchy base simmered in a flavorful broth or sauce. Here's a general procedure:

1. Gather all ingredients - meat or fish, vegetables, spices, oil, starch (cassava, yam, rice, etc.)
2. Wash and chop vegetables and starch. Grind tomatoes, onions, peppers if making a tomato stew. 
3. Season meat/fish with salt, onions, garlic, ginger. 
4. Heat oil in a pot. Add meat/fish and brown on all sides. Remove and set aside.
5. Sauté onions and ground vegetables in the pot until softened.
6. Return meat to pot. Add stock/water, chopped vegetables and bring to a boil.
7. Reduce heat, cover and simmer until meat is tender.
8. Add starches and continue cooking until thickened. Season to taste.

### Serving a Balanced Ghanaian Meal
A typical Ghanaian meal consists of a soup or stew with a starchy side like rice, fufu, banku or yam. To make sure the meal is nutritionally balanced:

- Include a protein (meat, fish, beans, eggs)
- Add plenty of vegetables to soups and stews
- Incorporate healthy fats from palm oil, coconut oil, groundnuts, avocados
- Control portion sizes, especially of starchy items
- Avoid excessive sugar and salt

Here's an example of a well-rounded Ghanaian meal:

| Dish | Food Group |
|-|-|
| Groundnut soup with chicken | Protein, vegetables, healthy fats |
| Boiled yam | Healthy carbohydrates |
| Steamed greens | Vitamins & minerals |
| Fresh fruit | Fiber, vitamins |

- Wash hands thoroughly before cooking and eating
- Rinse fresh produce in clean water 
- Cook foods to safe internal temperatures
- Avoid cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods
- Store foods properly in sealed containers
