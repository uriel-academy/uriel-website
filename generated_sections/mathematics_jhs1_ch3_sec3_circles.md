## Introduction
Circles are everywhere in our daily lives, from the wheels on a bicycle to the coins in our pockets. In Ghana, we often encounter circles when dealing with money, such as calculating the area of a circular farm or determining the circumference of a large pot for cooking jollof rice. Understanding the properties and formulas related to circles is essential for success in mathematics and everyday life. As you prepare for the BECE exam, mastering circle concepts will help you solve problems efficiently and accurately.

Imagine you are helping your mother sell circular trays of eggs at the market. To determine the price for each tray, you need to know the area of the tray. By applying the formulas you will learn in this section, you can easily calculate the area and set a fair price for the eggs. This is just one example of how understanding circles can be useful in real-life situations in Ghana.

## Main Content
### Parts of a Circle
A circle is a closed, two-dimensional shape where all points on the boundary are equidistant from the center. The main parts of a circle are:
- **Center**: The point inside the circle that is equidistant from all points on the boundary.
- **Radius (r)**: The distance from the center to any point on the circle's boundary.
- **Diameter (d)**: The distance across the circle, passing through the center. It is twice the length of the radius (d = 2r).
- **Circumference (C)**: The distance around the outside of the circle.

### Circumference of a Circle
The circumference of a circle is the distance around its boundary. It can be calculated using either the radius or the diameter of the circle:
- Formula using radius: C = 2πr
- Formula using diameter: C = πd

Here, π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

| Formula | Use |
|---------|-----|
| C = 2πr | When the radius is known |
| C = πd  | When the diameter is known |

### Area of a Circle
The area of a circle is the space enclosed within its boundary. To calculate the area, you only need to know the radius of the circle:
- Formula: A = πr²

Here, π (pi) is the same mathematical constant used in the circumference formulas.

| Formula | Use |
|---------|-----|
| A = πr² | Calculates the area of a circle |

### Solving Circle Problems
To solve problems involving circles, follow these steps:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and what you need to find (circumference or area).
2. Write down the appropriate formula based on the given information.
3. Substitute the known values into the formula.
4. Simplify the equation and calculate the result.
5. Double-check your answer and ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.

## Worked Examples
1. Ama is making a circular blanket for her baby. If the blanket has a radius of 50 cm, what is its circumference?

Given: r = 50 cm
Formula: C = 2πr

Step 1: Substitute the radius into the formula.
C = 2π(50)

Step 2: Simplify the equation and calculate the result.
C = 100π ≈ 314.16 cm

Therefore, the circumference of the blanket is approximately 314.16 cm.

2. Kofi wants to fence a circular garden with a diameter of 6 meters. How much fencing does he need?

Given: d = 6 m
Formula: C = πd

Step 1: Substitute the diameter into the formula.
C = π(6)

Step 2: Simplify the equation and calculate the result.
C = 6π ≈ 18.85 m

Therefore, Kofi needs approximately 18.85 meters of fencing for his circular garden.

3. A circular pizza has an area of 154 square inches. What is the radius of the pizza?

Given: A = 154 in²
Formula: A = πr²

Step 1: Substitute the area into the formula.
154 = πr²

Step 2: Divide both sides by π to isolate r².
154 ÷ π = r²

Step 3: Calculate the square root of both sides to find the radius.
√(154 ÷ π) = r
r ≈ 7 in

Therefore, the radius of the pizza is approximately 7 inches.

## Practice Problems
1. A circular running track has a radius of 70 meters. Calculate the distance around the track. (Answer: 439.82 m)

2. A circular table has a diameter of 1.5 meters. What is the circumference of the table? (Answer: 4.71 m)

3. A circular swimming pool has an area of 200 square meters. Find the radius of the pool. (Answer: 7.98 m)
