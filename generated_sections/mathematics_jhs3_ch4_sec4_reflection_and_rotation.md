## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Identify and distinguish between reflection and rotation transformations
2. Determine the image of a shape under a given reflection or rotation
3. Specify a reflection transformation using the line of reflection
4. Specify a rotation transformation using the center, direction, and angle of rotation

## Introduction
Imagine you are helping to design kente cloth patterns in your village. To create beautiful, symmetrical designs, you can use reflections and rotations. These transformations allow you to take a basic pattern and repeat it in interesting ways. Understanding reflections and rotations is not only useful for traditional crafts but also for modern technology. Mobile money apps often use reflections and rotations to secure transactions by encrypting data. As you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering these concepts will help you solve problems involving shapes, patterns, and coordinate geometry.

## Main Content

### Reflections
A **reflection** is a transformation that flips a shape across a line, called the **line of reflection**. The resulting shape is a mirror image of the original. To find the reflection of a point:
1. Draw a perpendicular line from the point to the line of reflection
2. Measure the distance from the point to the line of reflection
3. Extend the perpendicular line on the opposite side of the line of reflection by the same distance

The reflection of a shape is found by reflecting each vertex and connecting them in the same order as the original shape.

Properties of Reflections:
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Line of Reflection | The perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining a point and its image |
| Distance | A point and its image are equidistant from the line of reflection |
| Orientation | The image is a mirror reflection of the original shape |

### Rotations
A **rotation** is a transformation that turns a shape around a fixed point, called the **center of rotation**, by a specified angle and direction. To find the rotation of a point:
1. Identify the center of rotation, angle of rotation, and direction (clockwise or counterclockwise)
2. Draw a line from the center of rotation to the point
3. Rotate the line by the specified angle and direction
4. The endpoint of the rotated line is the image of the point under the rotation

The rotation of a shape is found by rotating each vertex and connecting them in the same order as the original shape.

Properties of Rotations:
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Center of Rotation | The point around which the shape is rotated |
| Angle of Rotation | The amount the shape is rotated, measured in degrees or radians |
| Direction | Clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) |

### Combining Reflections and Rotations
Reflections and rotations can be combined to create more complex transformations. For example:
- Two reflections across parallel lines result in a translation
- Two reflections across intersecting lines result in a rotation around the point of intersection
- A reflection followed by a rotation (or vice versa) results in a **glide reflection**

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Reflection
A farmer in the Eastern Region has a triangular plot of land with vertices A(2, 1), B(5, 1), and C(2, 4). Find the coordinates of the plot after a reflection across the y-axis.

Solution:
To reflect a point (x, y) across the y-axis, we change the sign of the x-coordinate.

A(2, 1) → A'(-2, 1)
B(5, 1) → B'(-5, 1)
C(2, 4) → C'(-2, 4)

Therefore, the coordinates of the reflected plot are A'(-2, 1), B'(-5, 1), and C'(-2, 4).

### Example 2: Rotation
A student in Kumasi is designing a logo for a new mobile money app. The logo consists of a square ABCD with vertices A(1, 1), B(4, 1), C(4, 4), and D(1, 4). If the logo is rotated 90° counterclockwise around the origin, what are the coordinates of the rotated square?

Solution:
To rotate a point (x, y) 90° counterclockwise around the origin, we use the rule (x, y) → (-y, x).

A(1, 1) → A'(-1, 1)
B(4, 1) → B'(-1, 4)
C(4, 4) → C'(-4, 4)
D(1, 4) → D'(-4, 1)

Therefore, the coordinates of the rotated square are A'(-1, 1), B'(-1, 4), C'(-4, 4), and D'(-4, 1).

## Practice Problems
1. A rectangle has vertices P(1, 2), Q(5, 2), R(5, 6), and S(1, 6). Find the coordinates of the rectangle after a reflection across the line x = 3.

2. A regular pentagon ABCDE has vertex A at (2, 0). If the pentagon is rotated 72° clockwise around the origin, find the coordinates of the rotated pentagon.

3. A trapezoid PQRS has vertices P(1, 1), Q(4, 1), R(3, 4), and S(2, 4). Find the coordinates of the trapezoid after a reflection across the x-axis, followed by a rotation of 180° around the origin.
