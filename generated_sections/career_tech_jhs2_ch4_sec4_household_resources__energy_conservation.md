## Learning Objectives
After completing this section, students will be able to:
1. Identify common household appliances that consume energy
2. Apply energy-saving techniques when using lights, air conditioners, and refrigerators
3. Conduct an energy audit of their home and school
4. Create an energy conservation plan for their household

## Introduction
Energy conservation is an essential aspect of home management in Ghana. By reducing energy consumption, households can save money on utility bills and contribute to a more sustainable environment. Ghanaian students can apply energy-saving techniques in their daily lives and future careers, whether they become entrepreneurs, market vendors, or work in various industries. Local businesses, such as tailors, food sellers, and carpenters, can also benefit from adopting energy conservation practices to reduce operational costs and increase profitability.

## Main Content
### Understanding Energy Consumption
**Energy consumption** refers to the amount of energy used by household appliances and devices. Common energy-consuming appliances in Ghanaian homes include:
- Lights (incandescent bulbs, CFLs, LEDs)
- Air conditioners
- Refrigerators
- Televisions
- Electric stoves and ovens

### Energy-Saving Techniques
1. **Lighting**:
   - Replace incandescent bulbs with energy-efficient CFLs or LEDs
   - Turn off lights when not in use
   - Use natural light during the day
2. **Air Conditioning**:
   - Set the thermostat to 25°C or higher
   - Clean air filters regularly
   - Close windows and doors when the AC is on
3. **Refrigeration**:
   - Set the refrigerator temperature between 1°C and 5°C
   - Avoid overloading the refrigerator
   - Clean the condenser coils regularly

### Conducting an Energy Audit
An **energy audit** is a process of assessing the energy consumption of a building. To conduct an energy audit:
1. Make a list of all energy-consuming appliances
2. Record the wattage and hours of use for each appliance
3. Calculate the total energy consumption using the formula:
   - Energy consumption (kWh) = Wattage (W) × Hours of use (h) ÷ 1000

| Appliance   | Wattage (W) | Hours of use per day (h) | Energy consumption (kWh) |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------| 
| Light bulb  | 60          | 5                        | 0.3                      |
| Television  | 150         | 3                        | 0.45                     |
| Refrigerator| 200         | 24                       | 4.8                      |
