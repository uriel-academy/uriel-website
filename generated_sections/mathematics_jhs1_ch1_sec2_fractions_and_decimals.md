## Introduction
Fractions and decimals are essential concepts in mathematics that have many applications in our daily lives. In Ghana, we use fractions and decimals when dealing with money, measurements, and even in preparing our favorite dishes. For example, when you go to the market to buy ingredients for your favorite stew, you might need to purchase half a kilogram of meat or a quarter of a liter of palm oil. Understanding fractions and decimals is also crucial for managing your mobile money account and making sure you receive the correct change when buying items. As you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering fractions and decimals will help you solve problems quickly and accurately, giving you an advantage in the exam hall.

## Main Content
### Converting between Fractions and Decimals
To convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, to convert $\frac{3}{4}$ to a decimal, divide 3 by 4:

$\frac{3}{4} = 3 \div 4 = 0.75$

To convert a decimal to a fraction, write the decimal as a fraction with a denominator of a power of 10, then simplify if necessary. For example, to convert 0.6 to a fraction:

$0.6 = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$

### Comparing and Ordering Fractions and Decimals
To compare fractions with the same denominator, compare the numerators. The fraction with the larger numerator is greater. For example, $\frac{3}{5} > \frac{2}{5}$ because 3 > 2.

To compare fractions with different denominators, convert them to decimals or find a common denominator. For example, to compare $\frac{2}{3}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$:

$\frac{2}{3} = 0.666...$ and $\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$, so $\frac{3}{4} > \frac{2}{3}$

To compare decimals, compare the digits from left to right. The decimal with the greater value in the first differing digit is greater. For example, 0.78 > 0.65 because 7 > 6.

### Adding and Subtracting Fractions and Decimals
To add or subtract fractions with the same denominator, add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same. For example:

$\frac{2}{7} + \frac{3}{7} = \frac{5}{7}$

To add or subtract fractions with different denominators, find a common denominator first. For example:

$\frac{1}{3} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{12} - \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{12}$

To add or subtract decimals, line up the decimal points and add or subtract as if they were whole numbers. For example:

$1.23 + 4.56 = 5.79$

### Solving Real-World Problems
To solve real-world problems involving fractions and decimals, follow these steps:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the question being asked.
2. Convert fractions and decimals to the same representation if necessary.
3. Perform the required operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
4. Interpret the result in the context of the problem and write your answer with the appropriate unit.

## Worked Examples
1. Kofi has a rope that is $2\frac{1}{4}$ meters long. He cuts off $\frac{3}{4}$ of a meter to tie a package. How much rope does Kofi have left?
[IMAGE: A rope with a section cut off]

Step 1: Identify the given information and the question.
- Kofi's rope is $2\frac{1}{4}$ meters long.
- He cuts off $\frac{3}{4}$ of a meter.
- We need to find the remaining length of the rope.

Step 2: Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction.
$2\frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4}$

Step 3: Subtract the cut portion from the original length.
$\frac{9}{4} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{6}{4}$

Step 4: Simplify the result and write the answer with the appropriate unit.
$\frac{6}{4} = 1\frac{1}{2}$ meters

Therefore, Kofi has $1\frac{1}{2}$ meters of rope left.

2. Ama bought 2.5 kg of rice and 1.75 kg of beans. What is the total weight of her purchase?

Step 1: Identify the given information and the question.
- Ama bought 2.5 kg of rice and 1.75 kg of beans.
- We need to find the total weight of her purchase.

Step 2: Add the weights of the rice and beans.
$2.5 + 1.75 = 4.25$

Step 3: Write the answer with the appropriate unit.
Ama's total purchase weight is 4.25 kg.

3. Kwame has a rectangular piece of land that measures 12.6 meters by 8.4 meters. He wants to fence the land using posts placed every $1\frac{1}{2}$ meters. How many posts does Kwame need?
[IMAGE: A rectangular piece of land with fence posts]

Step 1: Identify the given information and the question.
- The land measures 12.6 meters by 8.4 meters.
- Fence posts are placed every $1\frac{1}{2}$ meters.
- We need to find the number of posts required.

Step 2: Calculate the perimeter of the land.
Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
Perimeter = 2 × (12.6 + 8.4) = 2 × 21 = 42 meters

Step 3: Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction.
$1\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}$

Step 4: Divide the perimeter by the distance between posts and round up to the nearest whole number.
Number of posts = $\frac{42}{\frac{3}{2}} = 42 \div \frac{3}{2} = 42 \times \frac{2}{3} = 28$

Therefore, Kwame needs 28 fence posts.

## Practice Problems
1. Convert $\frac{7}{8}$ to a decimal.
2. Order the following fractions from least to greatest: $\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{5}{6}$.
3. Adwoa spent $\frac{2}{5}$ of her money on a dress and $\frac{1}{4}$ on a pair of shoes. What fraction of her money did she spend altogether?
4. The price of a liter of petrol increased from GH₵ 6.45 to GH₵ 6.78. How much was the increase per liter?

Answers:
1. 0.875
2. $\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{3}, \frac{5}{6}$
3. $\frac{13}{20}$
4. GH₵ 0.33
