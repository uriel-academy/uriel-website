## Introduction
Sewing is an essential skill that has been part of Ghanaian culture for generations. From the colorful kente cloth woven in the Ashanti region to the intricate adinkra symbols stamped on fabric, Ghanaians have a rich history of textile arts. Learning basic sewing stitches like the running stitch and backstitch will help you mend your own clothes, create useful items like bags and aprons, and maybe even start your own business as a tailor or seamstress. Many successful Ghanaian fashion designers started with just a needle, thread, and a passion for sewing. With practice and creativity, you too can develop this valuable skill and maybe even become the next big name in African fashion!

### Threading the Needle and Tying a Knot
Before you can start sewing, you need to thread your needle and tie a knot. Follow these steps:
1. Cut a piece of thread about 18 inches long.
2. Moisten one end of the thread with saliva and twist it into a point.
3. Push the pointed end through the eye of the needle.
4. Pull the thread through until the ends are even.
5. Tie a knot at the end of the thread by looping it around your finger, rolling it between your thumb and finger, and pulling tight.

### Running Stitch
The **running stitch** is a simple stitch used for mending, gathering fabric, or sewing seams.
To sew a running stitch:
1. Pin your fabric together with the right sides facing.
2. Insert the needle into the fabric from the back to the front, about 1/4 inch from the edge.
3. Push the needle through to the back of the fabric about 1/4 inch from the first stitch.
4. Continue in a straight line, keeping the stitches even and the same length.
5. Finish the seam by pulling the needle to the back and tying off the thread with a knot.

### Backstitch
The **backstitch** is a stronger stitch used for seams and hems that need to be durable.
To sew a backstitch:
1. Start as you would for a running stitch, but take one stitch back to the end of the previous stitch.
2. Insert the needle 1/8 inch ahead of this backstitch and pull the thread through.
3. Push the needle 1/8 inch ahead again, and insert it back to meet the end of the previous stitch.
4. Continue along the seam in this forward-backward motion, keeping the stitches straight and even.
5. Tie off securely on the back side.

| Safety Precautions |
|------------|
| Always keep needles and pins in a safe place, like a pincushion or box, when not in use |
| Be careful when using scissors - cut away from your body and keep fingers clear of blades | 
| Wear a thimble to protect your fingers when pushing the needle through thick fabric |
| Wash your hands before handling light-colored fabric to avoid stains |

## Practical Activity
### Drawstring Bag
Now let's put your new sewing skills to use by making a simple drawstring bag. You can use this bag to carry books, store sewing supplies, or give as a gift.

Materials:
- Two rectangles of medium-weight fabric, 8 inches by 10 inches (you can use chitenge, wax print, or any colorful local fabric)
- 1 yard of ribbon, twine, or cord for the drawstring
- Needle and thread
- Fabric scissors
- Pins

Instructions:
1. Cut your fabric into two rectangles, each 8 inches wide and 10 inches tall.
2. Pin the rectangles together with right sides facing, along the 8 inch sides and one 10 inch side.
3. Sew the pinned sides with a running stitch, using a 1/4 inch seam allowance. Tie off securely and remove pins.
4. Fold the top edge of the bag down 1/2 inch and press with an iron. Fold down another 1 1/2 inches and pin in place. This will create the casing for your drawstring.
5. Sew along the bottom folded edge with a backstitch, leaving the ends open. Remove pins.
6. Turn the bag right-side out and press flat.
7. Attach a large safety pin to one end of your ribbon or cord. Insert the pin into the casing and guide it through until it comes out the other side.
8. Tie the ends of the ribbon together and trim the excess. Your drawstring bag is done!
