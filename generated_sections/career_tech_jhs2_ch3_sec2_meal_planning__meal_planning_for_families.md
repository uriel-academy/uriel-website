### Understanding Nutritional Needs
Every family member has unique nutritional needs based on their age, gender, and activity level. Here's a quick guide:
- Children and teenagers need plenty of protein, calcium, and vitamins for growth and development
- Pregnant and breastfeeding women require extra calories, iron, and folic acid

- **Vegetables** like kontomire, garden eggs, and okra
- **Fruits** like mango, pineapple, and watermelon
