## Introduction
Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It plays a crucial role in solving real-world problems and is essential for higher-level mathematics. In Ghana, algebra is used in various aspects of daily life, such as calculating profits at the market, managing personal finances through mobile money, and even in farming when determining the amount of fertilizer needed for a specific land area.

For Ghanaian JHS 1 students, understanding algebraic expressions is a key component of the BECE mathematics curriculum. By mastering the concepts and skills taught in this section, you will be better prepared to tackle the challenges presented in the BECE exam and build a strong foundation for future mathematical learning.

## Main Content
### Variables and Algebraic Expressions
In algebra, we use **variables** to represent unknown quantities. A variable is typically a letter, such as x, y, or z, that stands in place of a number. An **algebraic expression** is a combination of variables, numbers, and operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

For example, if we let x represent the number of mangoes sold at a market, then the expression 2x + 5 could represent the total cost of the mangoes, where each mango costs GH₵2, and there is an additional fixed cost of GH₵5.

### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions
To simplify an algebraic expression, we perform the given operations and combine like terms. **Like terms** are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers.

For example, consider the expression 3x + 2y - x + 4y. To simplify this, we combine like terms:
- 3x - x = 2x
- 2y + 4y = 6y

So, the simplified expression is 2x + 6y.

### Evaluating Algebraic Expressions
To evaluate an algebraic expression, we substitute a specific value for each variable and then compute the result.

For instance, let's evaluate the expression 2x + 3 when x = 5:
- 2x + 3 = 2(5) + 3
- 2x + 3 = 10 + 3
- 2x + 3 = 13

### Translating Word Problems into Algebraic Expressions
Many real-world problems can be solved using algebra. To do this, we need to translate the word problem into an algebraic expression.

Let's consider an example:
> Kofi is 3 years older than Ama. If Ama's age is represented by a, write an expression for Kofi's age.

In this case, we can express Kofi's age as a + 3.

## Worked Examples
1. Simplify the expression 4x - 2y + 3x + 5y - 7.
   - 4x + 3x - 2y + 5y - 7
   - 7x + 3y - 7
   
2. Evaluate the expression 3x^2 - 2x + 1 when x = 4.
   - 3(4)^2 - 2(4) + 1
   - 3(16) - 8 + 1
   - 48 - 8 + 1
   - 41
   
3. Adwoa bought 3 pens and 2 notebooks. Each pen costs GH₵1.50, and each notebook costs GH₵4. Write an algebraic expression for the total cost of Adwoa's purchase.

Let p represent the number of pens and n represent the number of notebooks.
Total cost = (cost per pen × number of pens) + (cost per notebook × number of notebooks)
Total cost = 1.50p + 4n

For Adwoa's purchase:
Total cost = 1.50(3) + 4(2) = 4.50 + 8 = GH₵12.50

## Practice Problems
1. Simplify the expression 5m - 3n + 2m - 6n + 1.
2. Evaluate the expression 2x^2 + 3x - 1 when x = -2.
3. Kwame is 5 years younger than twice Abena's age. If Abena's age is represented by b, write an expression for Kwame's age.

Answers:
1. 7m - 9n + 1
2. 5
3. 2b - 5
