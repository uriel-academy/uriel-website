## Introduction
Data collection is a crucial aspect of statistics that plays a significant role in various facets of Ghanaian life. For instance, market traders often conduct informal surveys to determine the preferences and needs of their customers, enabling them to stock the most sought-after products. In agriculture, farmers may collect data on crop yields, rainfall patterns, and soil quality to make informed decisions about planting and harvesting. Moreover, as students prepare for the BECE exams, understanding data collection methods can help them interpret and analyze statistical information presented in various subjects.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts and techniques of data collection, empowering students to gather and interpret data effectively. By mastering these skills, students will be well-equipped to tackle real-world problems and excel in their academic pursuits, particularly in preparation for the WAEC/BECE exams.

## Main Content

### Types of Data Collection
There are three main types of data collection:
1. **Surveys**: Collecting data by asking questions to a group of people.
2. **Observational studies**: Collecting data by observing and recording information without influencing the subjects.
3. **Experiments**: Collecting data by manipulating one or more variables and observing the effects on other variables.

### Sampling Techniques
When collecting data, it is often impractical to gather information from an entire population. Instead, we use sampling techniques to select a representative subset of the population. Some common sampling techniques include:
1. **Simple random sampling**: Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
2. **Stratified sampling**: The population is divided into distinct subgroups (strata), and samples are taken from each stratum.
3. **Cluster sampling**: The population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected.

### Sample Size and Margin of Error
The sample size is the number of individuals or objects included in a study. A larger sample size generally leads to more accurate results but also increases the cost and time required for data collection. The margin of error is the maximum expected difference between the sample results and the true population values.

To determine the appropriate sample size, use the following formula:

$n = \frac{z^2 \times p(1-p)}{e^2}$

where:
- $n$ is the sample size
- $z$ is the z-score (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% confidence level)
- $p$ is the expected proportion (0.5 is often used if unknown)
- $e$ is the margin of error (as a decimal)

### Sources of Bias
Bias can occur at various stages of data collection and can lead to inaccurate or misleading results. Some common sources of bias include:
1. **Sampling bias**: When the sample is not representative of the population.
2. **Response bias**: When participants provide inaccurate or incomplete responses.
3. **Observer bias**: When the researcher's expectations or prejudices influence the data collection process.

To minimize bias, researchers should:
- Use appropriate sampling techniques
- Ensure clear and unambiguous questions or instructions
- Blind observers to the purpose of the study when possible
- Use standardized procedures and instruments

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Determining Sample Size
A researcher wants to estimate the proportion of students in a school who prefer football to basketball. The school has 1,200 students. If the researcher wants a margin of error of 5% with a 95% confidence level, what sample size should be used?

Given:
- Population size: 1,200 students
- Margin of error (e): 0.05
- Confidence level: 95% (z-score = 1.96)
- Expected proportion (p): 0.5 (unknown)

Using the formula: $n = \frac{z^2 \times p(1-p)}{e^2}$

$n = \frac{1.96^2 \times 0.5(1-0.5)}{0.05^2} = 384.16$

Rounding up, the researcher should use a sample size of at least 385 students.

### Example 2: Stratified Sampling
A mobile money company wants to survey its customers to determine their satisfaction with the service. The company has 10,000 customers, of which 6,000 are male and 4,000 are female. If the company wants a sample size of 500, how many male and female customers should be surveyed?

To ensure representative sampling, we use stratified sampling based on gender.

Male customers: $\frac{6,000}{10,000} \times 500 = 300$
Female customers: $\frac{4,000}{10,000} \times 500 = 200$

Therefore, the company should survey 300 male customers and 200 female customers.

### Example 3: Identifying Bias
A researcher conducted a survey to determine the average monthly income of workers in a city. The researcher stood outside a luxury shopping mall and asked 100 shoppers about their income.

Identify the potential source of bias in this study.

The potential source of bias is sampling bias. By surveying only shoppers at a luxury mall, the researcher is likely to oversample high-income individuals, leading to an overestimation of the average monthly income in the city. To obtain a more representative sample, the researcher should use a random sampling method that includes a diverse range of locations and individuals.

## Practice Problems
1. A farmer wants to estimate the average weight of the watermelons in his field. If he wants a margin of error of 2 kg with a 90% confidence level, and the expected standard deviation is 5 kg, what sample size should he use? (Answer: 51 watermelons)

2. A school has 500 students, of which 200 are in JHS 1, 150 in JHS 2, and 150 in JHS 3. If a sample of 60 students is needed for a survey, how many students should be selected from each grade level using stratified sampling? (Answer: JHS 1: 24, JHS 2: 18, JHS 3: 18)

3. A researcher wants to determine the proportion of households in a village that have access to electricity. The researcher surveys 50 households near the village center and finds that 90% have electricity. What is a potential source of bias in this study? (Answer: Sampling bias, as households near the village center may not be representative of the entire village)

## Summary
- Data collection involves gathering information through surveys, observational studies, or experiments.
- Sampling techniques, such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling, are used to select representative subsets of a population.
- Sample size is determined by the desired margin of error, confidence level, and expected proportion or standard deviation.
- Bias can occur due to sampling issues, response inaccuracies, or observer prejudice, and should be minimized through appropriate sampling, clear instructions, and standardized procedures.
