## Introduction
Translation is an essential concept in mathematics that has many applications in everyday life. In Ghana, we can see examples of translation all around us. For instance, when you transfer money using mobile money services like MTN MoMo or Vodafone Cash, the amount is translated from your account to the recipient's account. Similarly, when you buy goods at the market, the money you pay is translated from your pocket to the seller's.

In the context of the BECE exam, understanding translation is crucial for solving problems related to vectors and transformations. By mastering this concept, you will be well-prepared to tackle these questions and excel in your exams.

## Main Content
### What is Translation?
**Translation** is a type of transformation that moves every point of a figure by the same distance in a given direction. It can be described using a **translation vector**, which specifies the distance and direction of the movement. A translation does not change the size, shape, or orientation of the figure.

The translation vector is typically represented as **v** = (x, y), where x and y are the horizontal and vertical components of the movement, respectively.

### Translating Points
To translate a point A(x, y) by a translation vector **v** = (a, b), we add the corresponding components of the point and the vector:

A'(x', y') = A(x, y) + **v**(a, b) = (x + a, y + b)

For example, if point P(3, 4) is translated by vector **v** = (2, -1), the image point P' will be:

P'(x', y') = P(3, 4) + **v**(2, -1) = (3 + 2, 4 - 1) = (5, 3)

### Translating Lines and Shapes
To translate a line or a shape, we apply the same translation vector to every point of the figure. The resulting image will be a line or shape that is parallel to the original figure and has the same length and area.

For example, consider a line segment AB with endpoints A(1, 2) and B(4, 6). If we translate this line segment by vector **v** = (-3, 1), the new endpoints will be:

A'(x', y') = A(1, 2) + **v**(-3, 1) = (1 - 3, 2 + 1) = (-2, 3)
B'(x', y') = B(4, 6) + **v**(-3, 1) = (4 - 3, 6 + 1) = (1, 7)

The translated line segment A'B' will have the same length as AB but will be shifted according to the translation vector.

### Properties of Translation
Translation has several important properties:
1. Translation preserves the size and shape of the figure.
2. Translation preserves the orientation of the figure.
3. The order of consecutive translations does not affect the final result (commutative property).
4. Translating a figure by a vector **v** followed by translating it by vector -**v** results in the original figure (inverse property).

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Preservation of size and shape | The image of a translated figure has the same size and shape as the original figure. |
| Preservation of orientation | The image of a translated figure has the same orientation as the original figure. |
| Commutative property | The order of consecutive translations does not affect the final result. |
| Inverse property | Translating a figure by a vector **v** followed by translating it by vector -**v** results in the original figure. |

## Worked Examples
1. A farmer in the Eastern Region of Ghana has a rectangular plot of land measuring 60 meters by 40 meters. She wants to move her crops to a new location 20 meters east and 15 meters north of the current location. What are the coordinates of the new plot's corners if the original plot's corners are at (0, 0), (60, 0), (60, 40), and (0, 40)?

Solution:
Let the translation vector be **v** = (20, 15).
New coordinates:
(0, 0) + (20, 15) = (20, 15)
(60, 0) + (20, 15) = (80, 15)
(60, 40) + (20, 15) = (80, 55)
(0, 40) + (20, 15) = (20, 55)

Therefore, the new plot's corners will be at (20, 15), (80, 15), (80, 55), and (20, 55).

2. A student in Accra is creating a design for a BECE project. She has a triangle with vertices A(2, 1), B(5, 3), and C(4, 6). She wants to translate the triangle by vector **v** = (-1, 2). Find the coordinates of the translated triangle's vertices.

Solution:
Translating each vertex by vector **v** = (-1, 2):

A'(x', y') = A(2, 1) + **v**(-1, 2) = (2 - 1, 1 + 2) = (1, 3)
B'(x', y') = B(5, 3) + **v**(-1, 2) = (5 - 1, 3 + 2) = (4, 5)
C'(x', y') = C(4, 6) + **v**(-1, 2) = (4 - 1, 6 + 2) = (3, 8)

The translated triangle's vertices are A'(1, 3), B'(4, 5), and C'(3, 8).

3. A mobile money agent in Kumasi wants to transfer GH₵500 from his MTN MoMo account to his Vodafone Cash account. After the transfer, his MTN MoMo balance is GH₵1,200, and his Vodafone Cash balance is GH₵800. If we represent his initial balances as a point (x, y) on a coordinate plane, where x is the MTN MoMo balance and y is the Vodafone Cash balance, find the coordinates of the point representing his initial balances.

Solution:
Let the initial balances be represented by point P(x, y).
The transfer of GH₵500 can be represented by the translation vector **v** = (-500, 500).

The final balances are represented by point P'(1200, 800).

Using the translation formula:
P'(x', y') = P(x, y) + **v**(-500, 500)
(1200, 800) = (x, y) + (-500, 500)
(1200, 800) = (x - 500, y + 500)

Equating the corresponding components:
x - 500 = 1200
x = 1200 + 500 = 1700

y + 500 = 800
y = 800 - 500 = 300

Therefore, the initial balances were GH₵1,700 in the MTN MoMo account and GH₵300 in the Vodafone Cash account, represented by point P(1700, 300).

## Practice Problems
1. A rectangle ABCD has vertices A(1, 2), B(5, 2), C(5, 6), and D(1, 6). Translate the rectangle by vector **v** = (3, -4). Find the coordinates of the translated rectangle's vertices.

2. A line segment PQ has endpoints P(-2, 3) and Q(4, -1). If the line segment is translated by vector **v** = (0, 5), find the midpoint of the translated line segment.

3. A market vendor in Takoradi buys 20 kilograms of rice for GH₵150 and sells it for GH₵180. If we represent the buy and sell prices as a point (x, y) on a coordinate plane, where x is the buy price and y is the sell price, find the translation vector that represents the vendor's profit.

Answers:
1. A'(4, -2), B'(8, -2), C'(8, 2), D'(4, 2)
2. (2, 6)
3. **v** = (0, 30)

## Summary
- Translation is a transformation that moves every point of a figure by the same distance in a given direction.
- To translate a point, add the translation vector to the point's coordinates.
- To translate a line or shape, apply the same translation vector to every point of the figure.
- Translation preserves the size, shape, and orientation of the figure.
- Consecutive translations are commutative, and translating by a vector followed by its inverse results in the original figure.
