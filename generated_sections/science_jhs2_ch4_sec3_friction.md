## Introduction
Friction is a force that we encounter every day in our lives, whether we're walking on the streets of Accra, playing football on a field, or even writing with a pencil. In Ghana, friction plays a crucial role in various activities, such as farming, transportation, and construction. For example, when farmers in the cocoa-growing regions of Ghana use machetes to harvest cocoa pods, friction between the machete and the pod helps to cut through the tough outer shell. Similarly, the tires of vehicles traveling on the roads in Ghana experience friction, which allows them to grip the road surface and maintain control. Understanding friction is essential for Ghanaian students to apply this knowledge to real-life situations and make informed decisions.

## Main Content
### What is Friction?
**Friction** is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It acts parallel to the surfaces and always in a direction opposite to the motion or attempted motion. Friction arises due to the irregularities and roughness of the surfaces in contact, even if they appear smooth to the naked eye.

### Types of Friction
There are two main types of friction:
1. **Static friction**: This is the force that opposes the motion of an object when it is at rest but subjected to an external force. Static friction prevents the object from moving until the external force exceeds a certain threshold.
2. **Kinetic friction**: This is the force that opposes the motion of an object when it is already in motion. Kinetic friction is usually less than static friction and depends on the relative speed between the surfaces.

### Factors Affecting Friction
The magnitude of friction depends on several factors:
1. **Surface roughness**: Rougher surfaces have more irregularities, leading to greater friction.
2. **Normal force**: The force pressing the surfaces together. A greater normal force results in higher friction.
3. **Surface area**: The area of contact between the surfaces. However, friction is generally independent of the surface area.
4. **Type of material**: Different materials have different coefficients of friction, which determine the amount of friction between them.

| Surface Material | Coefficient of Static Friction | Coefficient of Kinetic Friction |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Wood on wood     | 0.4-0.6                        | 0.2-0.4                        |
| Metal on metal   | 0.1-0.6                        | 0.03-0.4                       |
| Rubber on dry concrete | 1.0                        | 0.7                            |

### Practical Example: Investigating Friction
Materials:
- A wooden block
- A piece of sandpaper
- A piece of smooth fabric
- A spring balance or force meter
- Weights

Procedure:
1. Attach the spring balance to the wooden block.
2. Place the block on a flat surface covered with sandpaper.
3. Gradually increase the force applied to the spring balance until the block starts moving. Record the force reading at this point (static friction force).
4. Continue pulling the block at a constant speed and record the force reading (kinetic friction force).
5. Repeat steps 2-4 using the smooth fabric instead of sandpaper.
6. Compare the static and kinetic friction forces for both surfaces.

## Worked Examples
1. A 2 kg wooden box is pushed across a concrete floor with a force of 10 N. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the floor is 0.3, calculate the frictional force acting on the box.

Given:
- Mass of the box (m) = 2 kg
- Applied force (F) = 10 N
- Coefficient of kinetic friction (μ) = 0.3

Step 1: Calculate the normal force (N) acting on the box.
N = m × g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s²)
N = 2 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 19.6 N

Step 2: Calculate the frictional force (f) using the formula: f = μ × N
f = 0.3 × 19.6 N = 5.88 N

Therefore, the frictional force acting on the box is 5.88 N.

2. A car with a mass of 1,500 kg is traveling at a constant speed on a level road. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the tires and the road is 0.7, calculate the frictional force acting on the car.

Given:
- Mass of the car (m) = 1,500 kg
- Coefficient of kinetic friction (μ) = 0.7

Step 1: Calculate the normal force (N) acting on the car.
N = m × g
N = 1,500 kg × 9.8 m/s² = 14,700 N

Step 2: Calculate the frictional force (f) using the formula: f = μ × N
f = 0.7 × 14,700 N = 10,290 N

Therefore, the frictional force acting on the car is 10,290 N.
