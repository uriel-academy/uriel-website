A balanced diet includes a variety of foods from the following key food groups:
1. **Carbohydrates**: Found in foods like rice, yam, plantain, cassava, and bread, carbohydrates provide energy for our daily activities.
2. **Proteins**: Found in foods like beans, groundnuts, fish, meat, and eggs, proteins help build and repair our body tissues.
3. **Fruits and Vegetables**: Rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, fruits and vegetables like okra, garden eggs, spinach, mangoes, and oranges support our immune system and digestion.
4. **Fats and Oils**: Found in foods like palm oil, coconut oil, and avocados, fats provide energy and help absorb certain vitamins.
