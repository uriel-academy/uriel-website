## Introduction
Tailoring is an important skill in Ghana that provides both practical benefits and career opportunities. Many Ghanaians rely on skilled tailors to create custom-fitted garments for everyday wear, special occasions, and cultural events. Seamstresses and tailors can be found in local markets, small shops, and even large textile factories across the country. Learning basic sewing and garment construction techniques empowers students to create and repair their own clothes, start a small tailoring business, or pursue further education in fashion design. Tailoring also teaches valuable skills like precise measuring, creative problem-solving, and attention to detail that are useful in many other careers.

Some inspiring examples of Ghanaian entrepreneurs in the fashion industry include Nora Bannerman, founder of Sleek Garments, one of Ghana's leading fashion houses that has dressed international figures. Aisha Ayensu, the creative director of Christie Brown fashion label, is another celebrated Ghanaian designer known for her modern African styles. Tailoring skills form the foundation for these kinds of successful fashion careers.

3. Keep the tape measure parallel to the floor
4. Record measurements carefully

### Constructing a Basic Garment
Follow these steps to sew a simple straight skirt:
1. Cut two rectangular pieces of fabric according to your hip measurement and desired length
2. Place the fabric pieces together with right sides facing and pin in place
3. **Baste** the side seams and try on the skirt to check the fit, adjusting if needed 
4. Sew the side seams with a **straight stitch**, **backstitch** at the beginning and end
5. Fold and press the waistband casing and hem, then **slipstitch** in place
6. Insert elastic into the waistband casing
