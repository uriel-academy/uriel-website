### The Importance of Tourism and Hospitality in Ghana
Tourism and hospitality are essential components of Ghana's economy. In 2019, the tourism sector contributed 5.5% to Ghana's GDP and employed over 682,000 people (World Travel & Tourism Council, 2020). **Tourism** involves the activities of people traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for leisure, business, or other purposes. **Hospitality**, on the other hand, refers to the services and amenities provided to tourists, such as accommodation, food and beverage, transportation, and entertainment.

The government and private sector can invest in infrastructure development, provide training and capacity building for hospitality workers, and promote sustainable tourism practices. By addressing these issues, Ghana can enhance its competitiveness as a tourist destination and maximize the benefits of tourism for its economy and people.
