# Chapter 1: Number and Numeration
## Section: Percentages

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Convert between percentages, decimals, and fractions
2. Calculate percentages of quantities
3. Solve percentage increase and decrease problems
4. Apply percentages to real-life situations (e.g., discounts, taxes, interest)

## Introduction
Percentages are an essential part of our daily lives in Ghana. When you go to the market to buy groceries, you might find a seller offering a 10% discount on yams. If you use mobile money to send funds to your family, the service provider may charge a 1% transaction fee. When farmers harvest their crops, they need to calculate the percentage of the yield that goes to different purposes, such as selling, storing, and planting for the next season. Understanding percentages is also crucial for your success in the BECE examination, as they are a common topic in the mathematics section. In this lesson, we will explore how to work with percentages and apply them to real-life situations.

## Main Content
### Converting between percentages, decimals, and fractions
A percentage is a fraction with a denominator of 100. To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide the percentage by 100. To convert a decimal to a percentage, multiply the decimal by 100 and add the % symbol.

To convert between fractions and percentages, first convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator, then multiply by 100 and add the % symbol.

### Calculating percentages of quantities
To find the percentage of a quantity, multiply the quantity by the percentage expressed as a decimal.

Formula: **Percentage of quantity = Quantity × (Percentage ÷ 100)**

For example, to calculate 15% of 80:
* 15% ÷ 100 = 0.15
* 80 × 0.15 = 12

So, 15% of 80 is 12.

### Percentage increase and decrease
To calculate a percentage increase or decrease, use the following formulas:

| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| Percentage increase | **Increase = Original value × (1 + Percentage increase ÷ 100)** |
| Percentage decrease | **Decrease = Original value × (1 - Percentage decrease ÷ 100)** |

For example, if a bag of rice that originally cost GH₵50 increases in price by 20%, the new price would be:
* Increase = 50 × (1 + 20 ÷ 100)
* Increase = 50 × 1.2 = GH₵60

### Applying percentages to real-life situations
Percentages are used in various real-life situations, such as:
- Discounts: A 15% discount on a GH₵100 item means you pay GH₵85.
- Taxes: If the VAT is 12.5%, an item with a pre-tax price of GH₵80 will cost GH₵90 (80 × 1.125).
- Interest: If your savings account earns 5% annual interest, a balance of GH₵1,000 will grow to GH₵1,050 after one year (1,000 × 1.05).

## Worked Examples
1. Kofi wants to buy a new phone that costs GH₵600. The store offers a 20% discount. How much will Kofi pay for the phone?
   * Discount = 600 × (20 ÷ 100) = GH₵120
   * Price after discount = 600 - 120 = GH₵480
   So, Kofi will pay GH₵480 for the phone.

2. Ama sold 250 kilograms of maize. She kept 15% for her family's consumption and sold the rest. How many kilograms of maize did Ama sell?
   * Maize kept = 250 × (15 ÷ 100) = 37.5 kg
   * Maize sold = 250 - 37.5 = 212.5 kg
   Therefore, Ama sold 212.5 kilograms of maize.

3. Kwame borrowed GH₵2,000 from a bank with a 10% annual interest rate. How much will he need to pay back after one year?
   * Interest = 2,000 × (10 ÷ 100) = GH₵200
   * Total payback = 2,000 + 200 = GH₵2,200
   Kwame will need to pay back GH₵2,200 after one year.

## Practice Problems
1. Convert 3/5 to a percentage.
2. A store offers a 25% discount on a dress originally priced at GH₵120. What is the discounted price?
3. Yaw's salary increased by 12% from GH₵1,500. What is his new salary?

Answers:
1. 60%
2. GH₵90
3. GH₵1,680

## Summary
- Percentages can be converted to decimals by dividing by 100, and to fractions by first converting to decimals.
- To find the percentage of a quantity, multiply the quantity by the percentage expressed as a decimal.
- Percentage increase: Increase = Original value × (1 + Percentage increase ÷ 100)
- Percentage decrease: Decrease = Original value × (1 - Percentage decrease ÷ 100)
- Percentages are used in real-life situations like discounts, taxes, and interest.
