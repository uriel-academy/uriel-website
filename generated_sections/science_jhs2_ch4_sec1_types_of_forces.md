## Introduction
Forces are an integral part of our daily lives, even if we don't always realize it. From the moment you wake up and put your feet on the ground, forces are at work. The force of gravity keeps you anchored to the Earth, while friction between your feet and the floor prevents you from slipping. When you kick a football, you exert a force on the ball, causing it to move. Even the construction of the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River relies on understanding forces to ensure its stability and efficient operation. In this section, we will explore the various types of forces and how they affect the world around us, with a focus on examples from Ghana.

## Main Content
### Fundamental Forces
In nature, there are four fundamental forces:
1. **Gravitational force**: This is the force of attraction between any two objects with mass. It keeps planets orbiting the sun and objects on Earth's surface.
2. **Electromagnetic force**: This force involves the interaction of electrically charged particles and magnetic fields. It is responsible for holding atoms together and everyday phenomena like static electricity.
3. **Strong nuclear force**: This force binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons, and holds the nucleus of an atom together.
4. **Weak nuclear force**: This force is involved in certain types of radioactive decay.

### Contact Forces
Contact forces occur when two objects are physically touching each other. Some common contact forces include:
- **Friction**: This force opposes the motion of objects sliding against each other. It is the resistance you feel when trying to push a heavy box across a floor. Friction can be useful, like when it helps your shoes grip the ground as you walk, or problematic, like when it causes wear and tear on machinery.
- **Tension**: This force occurs when a rope, cable, or similar object is pulled taut. It is the force that allows the cables of the Adomi Bridge to support the weight of vehicles and people crossing the Volta River.
- **Normal force**: This force acts perpendicular to the surface of an object and prevents objects from sinking into each other. It is the force that pushes up on you when you sit in a chair, preventing you from falling through it.

### Non-Contact Forces
Non-contact forces can act on objects without physical contact. Some examples include:
- **Gravitational force**: As mentioned earlier, gravity is a non-contact force that acts between any two objects with mass. It is the force that causes mangoes to fall from trees and keeps the moon orbiting the Earth.
- **Magnetic force**: This force acts between magnets and magnetic materials. It is the force that allows a compass needle to point north and is used in the construction of electric motors and generators.
- **Electrostatic force**: This force acts between electrically charged objects. It is the force that causes your hair to stand up when you rub a balloon against it and is the basis for technologies like inkjet printers.

### Practical Example: Measuring Friction
You can measure the force of friction using a simple experiment with materials found in your home or classroom.

Materials:
- A block of wood or other object
- A spring scale or force meter
- A piece of string
- Different surfaces (e.g., sandpaper, smooth tile, carpet)

Procedure:
1. Tie the string to the block of wood and attach the spring scale to the other end of the string.
2. Place the block of wood on a surface.
3. Slowly pull on the spring scale until the block starts to move. Record the force reading on the scale at the moment the block starts moving. This is the force of friction.
4. Repeat the experiment on different surfaces and compare the force of friction on each.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the force of gravity between the Earth (mass = 5.97 × 10^24 kg) and a person with a mass of 65 kg. The radius of the Earth is 6,371 km. Use Newton's law of universal gravitation: F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2, where G = 6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2.

Given:
- Mass of the Earth (m1) = 5.97 × 10^24 kg
- Mass of the person (m2) = 65 kg
- Radius of the Earth (r) = 6,371 km = 6.371 × 10^6 m

Solution:
F = (6.67 × 10^-11 N⋅m^2/kg^2) × (5.97 × 10^24 kg × 65 kg) / (6.371 × 10^6 m)^2
F = (6.67 × 10^-11) × (3.8805 × 10^26) / (4.0589 × 10^13)
F = 637.4 N

Therefore, the force of gravity between the Earth and a 65 kg person is approximately 637.4 N.

2. A crane lifts a 1,500 kg load of cocoa beans using a steel cable. If the acceleration due to gravity is 9.81 m/s^2, what is the tension in the cable?

Given:
- Mass of the load (m) = 1,500 kg
- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s^2

Solution:
The tension in the cable is equal to the weight of the load.
Weight = mass × acceleration due to gravity
Weight = 1,500 kg × 9.81 m/s^2 = 14,715 N

Therefore, the tension in the cable is 14,715 N.

## Summary
- The four fundamental forces in nature are gravitational force, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force.
- Contact forces, such as friction, tension, and normal force, occur when objects are physically touching.
- Non-contact forces, like gravity, magnetism, and electrostatic forces, can act on objects without physical contact.
- Forces play a crucial role in everyday life and in various industries in Ghana, such as agriculture, construction, and transportation.
- Understanding forces is essential for designing and maintaining structures, machines, and devices that are safe and efficient.
