- Calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) for a given set of data
- Solve real-world problems involving data analysis and interpretation

## Introduction
Data analysis plays a crucial role in our daily lives, especially in Ghana, where we encounter various situations that require mathematical understanding. From managing finances at the market to preparing for the BECE exams, the ability to interpret and analyze data is essential. Imagine you are helping your parents at their market stall, and you need to calculate the average price of the products they sell to ensure fair pricing. Or perhaps you are tracking your mobile money transactions to budget your expenses effectively. These real-world scenarios highlight the importance of data analysis skills in our everyday lives.

As Ghanaian JHS 3 students, you are preparing for the BECE exams, where data analysis questions are common. By mastering the concepts and techniques covered in this section, you will be well-equipped to tackle these questions confidently. Let's explore the world of data analysis and learn how to interpret and make sense of the information around us.

## Main Content
### Types of Data Representation
Data can be represented in various forms, including:
- **Tables**: Data organized in rows and columns
- **Charts**: Visual representation of data using bars, lines, or pie slices
- **Graphs**: Visual representation of data points on a coordinate plane

### Interpreting Data from Tables and Charts
To interpret data from tables and charts, follow these steps:
1. Identify the variables represented in the table or chart.
2. Observe the values associated with each variable.
3. Look for patterns, trends, or relationships between the variables.
4. Draw conclusions based on the observations.

For example, consider the following table showing the monthly sales of a market stall:

| Month    | Sales (GH₵) |
|----------|-------------|
| January  | 1,500       |
| February | 1,800       |
| March    | 2,200       |
| April    | 1,900       |

From the table, we can conclude that the sales increased from January to March and slightly decreased in April.

### Measures of Central Tendency
Measures of central tendency help us summarize data by finding a single value that represents the center of the dataset. The three main measures are:
1. **Mean**: The average value, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
2. **Median**: The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order.
3. **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently in the dataset.

To calculate the mean, use the formula:

$\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}$

For example, to find the mean of the numbers 4, 7, 2, 9, and 6:

$\text{Mean} = \frac{4 + 7 + 2 + 9 + 6}{5} = \frac{28}{5} = 5.6$

### Solving Real-World Problems
To solve real-world problems involving data analysis, follow these steps:
1. Identify the given information and the required output.
2. Determine the appropriate data analysis technique (e.g., calculating measures of central tendency, interpreting charts or graphs).
3. Apply the selected technique to the given data.
4. Interpret the results in the context of the problem.

## Worked Examples
1. The weekly sales (in GH₵) of a farmer's maize are recorded as follows: 120, 150, 100, 180, 200. Calculate the mean sales.

Solution:
Sum of sales = 120 + 150 + 100 + 180 + 200 = 750
Number of weeks = 5

$\text{Mean sales} = \frac{750}{5} = 150$

Therefore, the mean weekly sales of the farmer's maize is GH₵150.

2. The table below shows the number of students in each grade level at a Ghanaian school:

| Grade Level | Number of Students |
|-------------|-------------------|
| JHS 1       | 120               |
| JHS 2       | 100               |
| JHS 3       | 150               |

[IMAGE: Bar chart representing the data from the table]

What is the total number of students in the school?

Solution:
To find the total number of students, we add the number of students in each grade level:

$\text{Total students} = 120 + 100 + 150 = 370$

Therefore, there are 370 students in the school.

3. The distances (in km) traveled by a taxi driver in a day are: 25, 30, 18, 35, 22. Find the median distance traveled.

Solution:
First, arrange the distances in ascending order:
18, 22, 25, 30, 35

Since there are 5 values (an odd number), the median is the middle value.

Median distance = 25 km

## Practice Problems
1. The weights (in kg) of five bags of rice are: 50, 52, 48, 55, 51. Calculate the mean weight of the bags.

2. The chart below shows the distribution of mobile money transactions in a week:

[IMAGE: Pie chart showing the percentages of transactions for different purposes (e.g., bills, savings, transfers)]

Which category has the highest percentage of transactions?

3. The scores of 10 students on a BECE practice test are: 75, 80, 65, 90, 70, 85, 95, 60, 75, 80. Find the mode of the scores.

Answers:
1. 51.2 kg
2. The category with the largest slice in the pie chart
3. 75 and 80 (bimodal)
