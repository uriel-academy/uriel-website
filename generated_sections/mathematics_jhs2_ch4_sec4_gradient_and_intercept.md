## Introduction
Coordinate geometry is an essential branch of mathematics that combines algebra and geometry. It allows us to represent points, lines, and shapes on a coordinate plane using numbers. In Ghana, coordinate geometry has many practical applications. For example, when selling goods at the market, vendors often arrange their products in a grid-like pattern, similar to a coordinate plane. Understanding coordinate geometry can also help in calculating distances between towns or cities, which is crucial for transportation and logistics. Additionally, as you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering coordinate geometry will give you a strong foundation for solving various mathematical problems.

In this chapter, we will focus on the concepts of gradient and y-intercept, which are essential for understanding lines in coordinate geometry. We will explore how to calculate the gradient of a line, determine the equation of a line, and solve problems involving parallel and perpendicular lines. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid grasp of these concepts and be able to apply them in real-life situations and in your BECE exams.

## Main Content

### Understanding Gradient
The **gradient** of a line is a measure of its steepness. It represents the change in y-coordinate divided by the change in x-coordinate between any two points on the line. The gradient is denoted by the letter **m**.

Formula for gradient:
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are two points on the line.

| Gradient | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| $m > 0$  | Line slopes upwards from left to right |
| $m < 0$  | Line slopes downwards from left to right |
| $m = 0$  | Line is horizontal |
| $m$ is undefined | Line is vertical |

### Equation of a Line
The **equation of a line** is a formula that represents all the points on a line. It is typically written in the form:

$$y = mx + c$$

where $m$ is the gradient and $c$ is the **y-intercept**, which is the y-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

To find the equation of a line, you need to know:
- The gradient (m)
- One point on the line (x, y)

Step-by-step procedure:
1. Calculate the gradient using the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$
2. Substitute the gradient (m) and the coordinates of the known point (x, y) into the equation $y = mx + c$
3. Solve for c (y-intercept)
4. Write the final equation in the form $y = mx + c$

### Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
**Parallel lines** have the same gradient but different y-intercepts. Their equations will have the same m value but different c values.

**Perpendicular lines** have gradients that are negative reciprocals of each other. If the gradient of one line is m, the gradient of the perpendicular line will be $-\frac{1}{m}$.

### Solving Problems
To solve problems involving gradient and y-intercept, follow these steps:
1. Identify the given information (points, gradient, or y-intercept)
2. Determine what you need to find (gradient, equation of a line, or y-intercept)
3. Use the appropriate formula or procedure to calculate the required value
4. Interpret the result in the context of the problem

## Worked Examples

1. Find the gradient of the line passing through the points (2, 3) and (6, 9).

Step 1: Identify the points
- Point 1: $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 3)$
- Point 2: $(x_2, y_2) = (6, 9)$

Step 2: Use the gradient formula
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{9 - 3}{6 - 2} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5$$

Therefore, the gradient of the line is 1.5.

2. Find the equation of the line that passes through the point (1, 4) and has a gradient of -2.

Step 1: Identify the given information
- Point: $(x, y) = (1, 4)$
- Gradient: $m = -2$

Step 2: Use the equation $y = mx + c$ and substitute the given values
$$4 = -2(1) + c$$

Step 3: Solve for c
$$4 = -2 + c$$
$$c = 4 + 2 = 6$$

Step 4: Write the final equation
$$y = -2x + 6$$

3. A market vendor arranges her products in a grid-like pattern. She places a basket of oranges at the point (3, 2) and a basket of mangoes at the point (7, 8). Find the gradient of the line connecting the two baskets.

Step 1: Identify the points
- Oranges: $(x_1, y_1) = (3, 2)$
- Mangoes: $(x_2, y_2) = (7, 8)$

Step 2: Use the gradient formula
$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{8 - 2}{7 - 3} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5$$

Therefore, the gradient of the line connecting the two baskets is 1.5.

## Practice Problems

2. Determine the equation of the line that passes through the point (2, -5) and has a gradient of 3.

Answers:
1. $m = -\frac{4}{3}$
2. $y = 3x - 11$
3. $m = 3$
