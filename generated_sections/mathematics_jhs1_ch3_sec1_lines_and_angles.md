## Introduction
Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, and positions of objects. It has numerous applications in our daily lives, from the design of buildings to the calculation of distances. In Ghana, geometry plays a crucial role in various aspects of life. For example, market traders use geometric concepts to arrange their goods and calculate prices, while farmers use geometry to measure land and plan crop layouts. Understanding lines and angles, which are fundamental concepts in geometry, will not only help you excel in your BECE exams but also enable you to solve real-life problems efficiently.

Imagine you are helping your uncle to design a new roofing system for his house. To ensure that the roof is stable and properly aligned, you will need to apply your knowledge of angles and lines. By understanding the properties of parallel lines and the angles formed by the roof's support beams, you can create a strong and durable structure. Geometry is also essential when it comes to managing finances, such as calculating interest rates on mobile money transactions or determining the best value for money when comparing prices of goods in the market.

## Main Content
### Types of Lines and Angles
In geometry, there are different types of lines and angles:
- **Parallel lines**: Two lines that never intersect and maintain a constant distance apart
- **Perpendicular lines**: Two lines that intersect at a 90° angle
- **Acute angle**: An angle measuring less than 90°
- **Right angle**: An angle measuring exactly 90°
- **Obtuse angle**: An angle measuring greater than 90° but less than 180°
- **Straight angle**: An angle measuring exactly 180°

### Measuring and Constructing Angles
To measure angles, we use a protractor. A protractor is a semicircular tool with angle measurements marked on it. To measure an angle:
1. Place the center of the protractor on the vertex of the angle
2. Align one side of the angle with the 0° mark on the protractor
3. Read the measurement where the other side of the angle intersects the protractor scale

To construct an angle of a given size:
1. Draw a line and mark a point on it (the vertex)
2. Place the center of the protractor on the vertex and align the 0° mark with the line
3. Make a mark on the paper at the desired angle measurement
4. Remove the protractor and connect the vertex to the mark with a straight line

### Properties of Angles
Angles have several important properties:
- Angles on a straight line add up to 180°
- Angles at a point add up to 360°
- When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal, alternate angles are equal, and co-interior angles are supplementary (add up to 180°)

### Angles in Triangles and Quadrilaterals
In triangles:
- The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°
- In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal
- In an equilateral triangle, all angles measure 60°

In quadrilaterals:
- The sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is always 360°
- In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary
- In a rectangle, all angles are 90°
- In a square, all angles are 90°, and all sides are equal

| Shape         | Angle Sum | Properties                                 |
|---------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| Triangle      | 180°      | Isosceles: base angles equal                |
|               |           | Equilateral: all angles 60°                 |
| Quadrilateral | 360°      | Parallelogram: opposite angles equal        |
|               |           | Rectangle: all angles 90°                   |
|               |           | Square: all angles 90°, all sides equal     |

## Worked Examples
1. In a triangle ABC, angle A measures 50°, and angle B measures 70°. Calculate the size of angle C.

Step 1: Recall that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°.
Step 2: Let the size of angle C be x°. Then, 50° + 70° + x° = 180°.
Step 3: Simplify the equation: 120° + x° = 180°.
Step 4: Subtract 120° from both sides: x° = 180° - 120° = 60°.
Therefore, angle C measures 60°.

2. In the figure below, lines AB and CD are parallel, and line EF is a transversal. If angle AEF measures 120°, calculate the size of angle EFD.

Step 1: Recall that co-interior angles are supplementary (add up to 180°).
Step 2: Let the size of angle EFD be x°. Then, 120° + x° = 180°.
Step 3: Subtract 120° from both sides: x° = 180° - 120° = 60°.
Therefore, angle EFD measures 60°.

3. Kofi is designing a rectangular flower bed for his school garden. He wants the longer side of the flower bed to be 2 meters longer than the shorter side. If the perimeter of the flower bed is 20 meters, find the dimensions of the flower bed.

Step 1: Let the shorter side of the flower bed be x meters. Then, the longer side is (x + 2) meters.
Step 2: Recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(length + width).
Step 3: Set up an equation: 2(x + (x + 2)) = 20.
Step 4: Simplify the equation: 2(2x + 2) = 20.
Step 5: Distribute: 4x + 4 = 20.
Step 6: Subtract 4 from both sides: 4x = 16.
Step 7: Divide both sides by 4: x = 4.
Therefore, the shorter side of the flower bed is 4 meters, and the longer side is 6 meters.
