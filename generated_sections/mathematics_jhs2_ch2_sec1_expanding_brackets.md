# Chapter 2: Algebra
## Section: Expanding Brackets

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Expand single brackets with positive and negative terms.
2. Expand double brackets.
3. Apply the FOIL method to expand two binomials.
4. Solve real-life problems involving expanding brackets.

## Introduction
Algebra is a crucial branch of mathematics that helps us solve problems using symbols and equations. In Ghana, algebra is used in various aspects of daily life, such as calculating profits at the market, managing mobile money transactions, and determining the amount of fertilizer needed for a farm based on its size. Mastering the skill of expanding brackets is essential for Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE examination, as it forms a strong foundation for solving complex algebraic problems.

Imagine you are helping your mother sell vegetables at the market. If she knows the cost price and selling price of each vegetable, you can use algebra to calculate her profit by expanding the brackets in the expression: (selling price - cost price) × number of vegetables sold. By learning how to expand brackets, you will be equipped to solve such problems easily and quickly.

## Main Content
### Expanding Single Brackets
To expand a single bracket, multiply each term inside the bracket by the term outside the bracket. For example:
- 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6
- 3(2x - 1) = 6x - 3
- -4(3x + 2) = -12x - 8

### Expanding Double Brackets
When expanding double brackets, multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket. For example:
- (x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 5x + 6
- (2x - 1)(3x + 4) = 6x^2 + 5x - 4

### FOIL Method
The FOIL method is a technique for expanding two binomials. FOIL stands for:
- **F**irst terms
- **O**uter terms
- **I**nner terms
- **L**ast terms

To use the FOIL method:
1. Multiply the **First** terms of each bracket.
2. Multiply the **Outer** terms (the first term of the first bracket and the last term of the second bracket).
3. Multiply the **Inner** terms (the last term of the first bracket and the first term of the second bracket).
4. Multiply the **Last** terms of each bracket.
5. Add all the resulting terms together.

For example, to expand (2x + 3)(x - 4) using FOIL:
1. First: 2x × x = 2x^2
2. Outer: 2x × (-4) = -8x
3. Inner: 3 × x = 3x
4. Last: 3 × (-4) = -12
5. Add the terms: 2x^2 - 5x - 12

Properties of Expanding Brackets:
| Property | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Distributive Property | a(b + c) = ab + ac |
| Product of Sum and Difference | (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 |

Common Expansions:
| Expression | Expansion |
|------------|-----------|
| (a + b)^2  | a^2 + 2ab + b^2 |
| (a - b)^2  | a^2 - 2ab + b^2 |

## Worked Examples
1. Expand: 4(3x - 2)
   Step 1: Multiply 4 by each term inside the bracket.
   4(3x - 2) = 4 × 3x - 4 × 2
             = 12x - 8

2. Expand: (2x + 1)(x - 3)
   Step 1: Use the FOIL method.
   First: 2x × x = 2x^2
   Outer: 2x × (-3) = -6x
   Inner: 1 × x = x
   Last: 1 × (-3) = -3

   Step 2: Add the terms.
   (2x + 1)(x - 3) = 2x^2 - 5x - 3

3. Kofi is planning to buy a new phone. The phone's price is GH₵1,200, and he will also buy a case for GH₵50. If he plans to pay for the phone in 12 equal monthly installments, how much will each installment be?

   Let the monthly installment be x.
   Total cost = (Phone price + Case price)
              = 1200 + 50
              = 1250

   Equation: 12x = 1250

   Step 1: Divide both sides by 12.
   x = 1250 ÷ 12
   x = 104.17 (rounded to the nearest pesewa)

   Therefore, each monthly installment will be GH₵104.17.

## Practice Problems
1. Expand: 3(2x + 5)
2. Expand: (4x - 3)(2x + 1)
3. Ama is baking cookies for a school fundraiser. Each box contains 2 dozen cookies and sells for GH₵18. The ingredients for each box cost GH₵12. If she plans to bake 50 boxes, what will be her total profit?

Answers:
1. 6x + 15
2. 8x^2 - 10x - 3
3. GH₵300

## Summary
- To expand single brackets, multiply each term inside the bracket by the term outside the bracket.
- When expanding double brackets, multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket.
- The FOIL method is used to expand two binomials: multiply the First, Outer, Inner, and Last terms, then add the resulting terms.
- The distributive property states that a(b + c) = ab + ac.
- The product of sum and difference formula is (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2.
