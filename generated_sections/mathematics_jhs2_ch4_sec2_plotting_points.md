## Introduction
Coordinate geometry is an essential part of mathematics that connects algebra and geometry. It has many applications in everyday life, such as using GPS coordinates to locate places on a map or designing buildings and structures. In Ghana, coordinate geometry is used in various fields, including surveying land for farming, planning urban development, and even in mobile money transactions to track the flow of funds.

As Ghanaian students prepare for the BECE exams, mastering coordinate geometry will not only help them excel in their tests but also develop problem-solving skills that are valuable in their future careers. By understanding how to plot points and calculate distances on a coordinate plane, students can solve practical problems involving measurements and locations.

## Main Content
### The Cartesian Coordinate Plane
The Cartesian coordinate plane is a two-dimensional surface formed by two perpendicular number lines: the **horizontal axis** (also called the x-axis) and the **vertical axis** (also called the y-axis). The point where these axes intersect is called the **origin** and has coordinates (0, 0).

The coordinate plane is divided into four regions called **quadrants**, labeled with Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV.

### Plotting Points
To plot a point on the coordinate plane, we use an **ordered pair** of numbers called **coordinates**. The first number represents the position on the x-axis (called the **x-coordinate** or **abscissa**), and the second number represents the position on the y-axis (called the **y-coordinate** or **ordinate**). The coordinates are written in the form (x, y).

To plot a point with coordinates (x, y):
1. Start at the origin (0, 0)
2. Move horizontally along the x-axis:
   - To the right if x is positive
   - To the left if x is negative
3. Move vertically along the y-axis:
   - Up if y is positive
   - Down if y is negative
4. Mark the point where the two movements intersect

### Distance between Two Points
To find the distance between two points on a coordinate plane, we use the **distance formula**:

$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.

Steps to find the distance:
1. Identify the coordinates of the two points
2. Substitute the coordinates into the distance formula
3. Simplify the expression under the square root
4. Calculate the square root to find the distance

### Applying Coordinate Geometry
Coordinate geometry has many applications in real-world problems. For example:
- Calculating the distance between two towns on a map
- Determining the perimeter and area of a plot of land
- Designing floor plans for buildings
- Analyzing data on a graph

By understanding how to plot points and calculate distances, students can solve these types of problems efficiently and accurately.

## Worked Examples
1. Plot the points A(2, 3), B(-3, 1), C(0, -2), and D(4, -1) on a coordinate plane.

2. Find the distance between points P(1, 5) and Q(4, 2).

Using the distance formula:
$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

Substituting the coordinates:
$d = \sqrt{(4 - 1)^2 + (2 - 5)^2}$

Simplifying:
$d = \sqrt{3^2 + (-3)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{9 + 9}$
$d = \sqrt{18}$

Therefore, the distance between points P and Q is $\sqrt{18}$ units.

3. Kofi and Ama are playing a treasure hunt game on a coordinate plane. Kofi is at point K(-2, 3), and Ama is at point A(3, -1). If each unit on the coordinate plane represents 1 km, how far apart are Kofi and Ama?

Using the distance formula:
$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

Substituting the coordinates:
$d = \sqrt{(3 - (-2))^2 + (-1 - 3)^2}$

Simplifying:
$d = \sqrt{5^2 + (-4)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{25 + 16}$
$d = \sqrt{41}$

Therefore, Kofi and Ama are $\sqrt{41}$ km apart.

## Practice Problems
1. Plot the points P(-3, 2), Q(1, -4), R(2, 3), and S(-2, -1) on a coordinate plane.

2. Find the distance between points M(3, 7) and N(-2, 4).

3. Kwame and Adwoa are standing at opposite corners of a rectangular field. If Kwame is at point K(-5, 2) and Adwoa is at point A(3, -4), and each unit on the coordinate plane represents 10 meters, how far apart are Kwame and Adwoa?

Answers:

2. $\sqrt{34}$ units
3. 100$\sqrt{5}$ meters

## Summary
- The Cartesian coordinate plane consists of a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis, which intersect at the origin (0, 0).
- Points on the coordinate plane are represented by ordered pairs (x, y), where x is the position on the x-axis and y is the position on the y-axis.
- To plot a point, start at the origin, move horizontally according to the x-coordinate, then move vertically according to the y-coordinate.
- The distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ can be found using the distance formula: $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
- Coordinate geometry has many applications in real-world problems involving distances, measurements, and locations.
