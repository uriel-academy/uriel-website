### Threading an Advanced Sewing Machine
Correctly threading your machine is crucial for achieving neat, even stitches. Follow these steps:

1. Place the spool of thread on the spool pin.
2. Guide the thread through the thread guides and tension discs.
3. Thread the needle from front to back.
4. Pull the thread under the presser foot and to the back of the machine.
5. Insert the bobbin into the bobbin case and pull up the bobbin thread.

### Adjusting Stitch Settings
Advanced sewing machines allow you to adjust the stitch length, width, and tension to suit different fabrics and projects.

| Setting | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Stitch length | Controls the distance between stitches |
| Stitch width | Controls the side-to-side movement of the needle |
| Thread tension | Controls how tightly the upper and lower threads interlock |

To adjust these settings:
- Use the stitch length dial to choose a longer or shorter stitch.
- Use the stitch width dial to choose a wider or narrower zigzag stitch.
- Use the tension dial to loosen or tighten the upper thread tension.

### Machine Maintenance
Regular maintenance helps keep your sewing machine running smoothly. Key tasks include:

- **Cleaning**: Remove lint and dust from the bobbin case, feed dogs, and other parts using a brush.
- **Oiling**: Apply a few drops of sewing machine oil to moving parts like the shuttle hook.
- **Needle and presser foot**: Replace the needle regularly and use the correct presser foot for each project.
