## Introduction
Algebraic expressions are an essential part of mathematics that help us represent real-life situations using symbols and numbers. In Ghana, we encounter algebraic expressions in various aspects of our daily lives. For example, when you go to the market to buy groceries, you might need to calculate the total cost of your purchases. If you buy 2 kilograms of rice at GH₵5 per kilogram and 3 kilograms of beans at GH₵8 per kilogram, you can express the total cost as 2(5) + 3(8), which is an algebraic expression.

Similarly, when using mobile money services like MTN MoMo or Vodafone Cash, you might need to calculate the total amount you'll receive after sending money and deducting the transaction fee. If you send an amount 'x' and the transaction fee is 1% of the sent amount, you can express the total amount received as 0.99x, another algebraic expression.

As you prepare for your BECE exams, mastering the simplification of algebraic expressions will help you solve complex mathematical problems and apply your skills to real-life situations in Ghana.

## Main Content
### Terms, Coefficients, and Like Terms
In an algebraic expression, a **term** is a constant, a variable, or a product of constants and variables. For example, in the expression 3x + 5y - 2, the terms are 3x, 5y, and -2.

A **coefficient** is the numeric factor of a term that contains a variable. In the term 3x, the coefficient is 3.

**Like terms** are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers. For example, 2x and 7x are like terms, but 2x and 7x² are not.

### Combining Like Terms
To simplify an algebraic expression, we combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients. For example:

3x + 5x = (3 + 5)x = 8x
2y - 7y = (2 - 7)y = -5y

### Distributive Property
The **distributive property** states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. This property allows us to expand expressions. For example:

2(3x + 4) = 2(3x) + 2(4) = 6x + 8

### Simplifying Expressions with Multiple Operations and Brackets
When simplifying expressions with multiple operations and brackets, follow the order of operations: PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). For example:

2x + 3(4x - 5) - 2(x + 3)
= 2x + 12x - 15 - 2x - 6
= 2x + 12x - 2x - 15 - 6
= 12x - 21

## Worked Examples
1. Simplify: 5m - 3n + 2m + 7n
   * 5m + 2m = 7m
   * -3n + 7n = 4n
   * Simplified expression: 7m + 4n

2. Expand and simplify: 3(2x - 5) + 4(x + 3)
   * Distributive property: 3(2x - 5) = 6x - 15 and 4(x + 3) = 4x + 12
   * Combine like terms: 6x + 4x = 10x and -15 + 12 = -3
   * Simplified expression: 10x - 3

3. [IMAGE: A rectangular field with length (2x + 3) meters and width (x + 1) meters]
   Find the area of the field.
   * Area of a rectangle = length × width
   * A = (2x + 3)(x + 1)
   * Distributive property: A = 2x(x + 1) + 3(x + 1) = 2x² + 2x + 3x + 3
   * Combine like terms: A = 2x² + 5x + 3
   * The area of the field is (2x² + 5x + 3) square meters.

## Practice Problems
1. Simplify: 6a + 3b - 4a + 2b
2. Expand and simplify: 2(3x - 4) - 3(2x + 1)
3. [IMAGE: A rectangular garden with length (3x - 2) meters and width (2x + 1) meters]
   Find the area of the garden.

Answers:
1. 2a + 5b
2. -7
3. (6x² + x - 2) square meters
