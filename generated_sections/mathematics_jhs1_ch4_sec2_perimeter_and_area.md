## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concepts of perimeter and area and their applications in real life.
2. Calculate the perimeter and area of rectangles, squares, and triangles using appropriate formulas.
3. Solve problems involving perimeter and area in various contexts.
4. Apply the concepts of perimeter and area to solve BECE-style questions.

## Introduction
In our daily lives, we often encounter situations that involve measurements, such as calculating the amount of fencing needed to enclose a garden or determining the size of a room to buy the right amount of floor tiles. These situations require an understanding of perimeter and area. As Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE, it is essential to master these concepts to solve real-life problems and excel in your exams.

Imagine you are helping your parents at the market stall. A customer wants to know the area of a rectangular piece of cloth to determine if it's enough for their project. By learning about perimeter and area, you can quickly calculate the dimensions and provide the customer with the information they need. Similarly, when you start your own business or manage your finances using mobile money, understanding measurements will be crucial for making informed decisions.

## Main Content
### Understanding Perimeter
**Perimeter** is the distance around the outside of a shape. It is the sum of the lengths of all sides of a closed figure. To find the perimeter, we add the lengths of all the sides.

For a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$, the perimeter is given by:
$$ \text{Perimeter of Rectangle} = 2(l + w) $$

For a square with side length $s$, the perimeter is given by:
$$ \text{Perimeter of Square} = 4s $$

### Understanding Area
**Area** is the amount of space inside a closed figure. It is measured in square units, such as square centimeters (cm²), square meters (m²), or hectares (ha) for larger areas like farmland.

For a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$, the area is given by:
$$ \text{Area of Rectangle} = l \times w $$

For a square with side length $s$, the area is given by:
$$ \text{Area of Square} = s^2 $$

For a triangle with base $b$ and height $h$, the area is given by:
$$ \text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h $$

### Perimeter and Area Formulas
| Shape     | Perimeter Formula   | Area Formula      |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Rectangle | $2(l + w)$          | $l \times w$      |
| Square    | $4s$                | $s^2$             |
| Triangle  | $a + b + c$         | $\frac{1}{2}bh$   |

### Solving Perimeter and Area Problems
To solve problems involving perimeter and area, follow these steps:
1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the unknown value to be found.
2. Determine the shape of the object (rectangle, square, triangle, or composite shape).
3. Write down the appropriate formula for perimeter or area based on the shape.
4. Substitute the given values into the formula.
5. Perform the necessary calculations and simplify the result.
6. Include the appropriate unit in your final answer (e.g., cm, m², ha).

## Worked Examples
1. A rectangular garden has a length of 12 meters and a width of 5 meters. Find the perimeter and area of the garden.

Given:
- Length $(l) = 12$ meters
- Width $(w) = 5$ meters

Step 1: Calculate the perimeter
$$ \text{Perimeter} = 2(l + w) = 2(12 + 5) = 2(17) = 34 \text{ meters} $$

Step 2: Calculate the area
$$ \text{Area} = l \times w = 12 \times 5 = 60 \text{ square meters (m}^2\text{)} $$

Therefore, the perimeter of the garden is 34 meters, and the area is 60 square meters.

2. Kofi wants to buy a square floor mat for his room. If the side length of the mat is 2.5 meters, calculate the perimeter and area of the mat.

Given:
- Side length $(s) = 2.5$ meters

Step 1: Calculate the perimeter
$$ \text{Perimeter} = 4s = 4 \times 2.5 = 10 \text{ meters} $$

Step 2: Calculate the area
$$ \text{Area} = s^2 = 2.5^2 = 6.25 \text{ square meters (m}^2\text{)} $$

Therefore, the perimeter of the floor mat is 10 meters, and the area is 6.25 square meters.

3. A triangular plot of land has a base of 20 meters and a height of 15 meters. Calculate the area of the plot in hectares (ha).

Given:
- Base $(b) = 20$ meters
- Height $(h) = 15$ meters

Step 1: Calculate the area in square meters
$$ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 15 = 150 \text{ square meters (m}^2\text{)} $$

Step 2: Convert the area from square meters to hectares
$$ 1 \text{ hectare (ha)} = 10,000 \text{ square meters (m}^2\text{)} $$
$$ \text{Area in hectares} = \frac{150 \text{ m}^2}{10,000 \text{ m}^2/\text{ha}} = 0.015 \text{ hectares (ha)} $$

Therefore, the area of the triangular plot of land is 0.015 hectares.

## Practice Problems
