## Introduction
Electronics are all around us in modern Ghana. From the phones we use to chat with friends and family, to the TVs and radios that entertain us, to the electronic scales and cash registers used by market vendors - electronic devices make our daily lives easier. Understanding the basics of electronics empowers you to diagnose problems, make simple repairs, and even build your own devices. These skills are valuable for aspiring entrepreneurs looking to start electronics repair shops, or anyone who wants to save money by fixing their own gadgets.

Kofi, a student in Kumasi, learned basic electronics skills in JHS 3. He started repairing friends' and neighbors' phones and radios for small fees. After completing school, Kofi opened a successful electronics repair shop in the local market. His practical skills allowed him to build a profitable business serving his community. In this lesson, you'll begin developing the same valuable electronics abilities.

## Main Content

### Electronic Components and Symbols
Electronic circuits are made up of components like:
- **Resistors** which limit current flow 
- **Capacitors** which store electric charge
- **Diodes** which allow current to flow in only one direction
- **Transistors** which amplify current or act as switches

Each component has a standard schematic symbol used in circuit diagrams:

| Component | Symbol |
|-----------|--------|
| Resistor  | ⊤vvvv⊤  |  
| Capacitor | ‖      |
| Diode     | ⊳|◁     |
| Transistor| ⊶      |

### Reading Circuit Diagrams
Circuit diagrams use symbols to show how components are connected. Lines represent wires. For example, here is a simple circuit with a battery, switch, resistor and LED:

[IMAGE: Circuit diagram with battery, switch, resistor, LED]

Trace the path of current from the positive (+) battery terminal, through the switch, resistor, and LED, to the negative (-) terminal.

### Using a Multimeter
A **multimeter** is an instrument that measures voltage (volts), current (amps), and resistance (ohms). To measure:

1. Select correct function on multimeter dial (V for voltage, A for current, Ω for resistance)  
2. Connect black lead to COM port and red lead to VΩA port 
3. Touch probes to circuit points you want to measure
4. Read measurement on display

Always disconnect power before measuring resistance. Never exceed the maximum voltage or current rating for your multimeter.

### Soldering Basics
Soldering joins electrical components together using molten metal alloy called **solder**. Basic steps:

1. Heat soldering iron to around 300-400°C
2. Clean tip on damp sponge 
3. Touch tip to joint between wire and component lead
4. Feed solder into joint and let it melt
5. Remove iron and let joint cool

Use safety goggles and work in a ventilated area. The soldering iron tip is very hot - never touch it! 

### Diagnosing and Repairing Faults  
Common electronic faults include:
- Blown fuses
- Damaged wires or connections
- Malfunctioning switches
- Burnt out components like resistors

To diagnose, visually inspect for damage, check connections, test continuity with a multimeter. Compare voltages to expected values from the circuit diagram. 

Repair by replacing blown fuses, damaged wires, bad switches or burnt components. Resolder any broken connections. Always unplug the device before working on it.

## Practical Activity 
You will build a simple LED circuit:

Materials:
- 9V battery and snap connector
- Toggle switch
- 220 ohm resistor
- Red LED
- Hookup wire
- Solderless breadboard

Procedure:
1. Insert components into breadboard sockets 
2. Connect battery positive to one switch terminal 
3. Connect other switch terminal to resistor
4. Connect resistor to LED anode (longer leg)
5. Connect LED cathode (shorter leg) to battery negative

The LED should light up when you turn on the switch. If not, double check your connections and component orientations. Use your multimeter to measure voltages at different points.

## Career Connections
Electronics skills are valued in many careers:
- Electronics repair technicians fix phones, TVs, radios, etc. They work in repair shops, electronics stores, or factories.
- Electronic equipment assemblers build devices in factories, following circuit diagrams and using soldering.  
- Electrical and electronics engineers design circuits for new products. They need advanced education but start by learning basic principles.
- Entrepreneurs use electronics skills to offer repair services, sell gadgets, or develop new products to meet local needs.

- Recognize basic electronic components and their schematic symbols 
- Read simple circuit diagrams to see how components are connected
- Use a multimeter to measure voltage, current and resistance
- Solder wires and components to assemble circuits
- Diagnose common electronic faults and make simple repairs
