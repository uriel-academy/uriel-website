## Introduction
Factorization is a crucial skill in algebra that allows us to break down expressions into their smaller components. This process is essential for simplifying expressions, solving equations, and understanding the structure of polynomials. In everyday life, factorization can be applied to various situations, such as calculating the dimensions of a rectangular plot of land given its area, determining the number of items that can be bought with a certain amount of Ghana cedis, or even estimating the number of bags of maize that can be transported in a truck. Mastering factorization will not only help you excel in your mathematics exams like the BECE but also develop problem-solving skills that will be valuable throughout your life.

## Main Content
### Factoring out the Highest Common Factor (HCF)
The first step in factorization is to identify the highest common factor (HCF) of the terms in an algebraic expression. The HCF is the largest factor that divides all the terms without leaving a remainder. To factor out the HCF, follow these steps:

1. Identify the common factors of all terms in the expression.
2. Find the highest common factor among these common factors.
3. Divide each term by the HCF and write the result inside a pair of parentheses.
4. Write the HCF outside the parentheses.

Example:
Factor $12x^2 + 18x$

$HCF(12x^2, 18x) = 6x$
$12x^2 + 18x = 6x(2x + 3)$

### Factoring Trinomials of the Form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a = 1$
When factoring trinomials of the form $x^2 + bx + c$, we need to find two numbers whose sum is equal to $b$ and whose product is equal to $c$.

Steps:
1. Write down the factors of $c$.
2. Find a pair of factors whose sum is equal to $b$.
3. Write the trinomial as the product of two binomials using the factors found in step 2.

Example:
Factor $x^2 + 5x + 6$

Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6
1 + 6 = 7 (not equal to 5)
2 + 3 = 5 (equal to 5)

$x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)$

### Factoring Trinomials of the Form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a \neq 1$
When factoring trinomials of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a \neq 1$, we use the following steps:

1. Multiply $a$ and $c$.
2. Find the factors of the product $ac$ that add up to $b$.
3. Rewrite the trinomial using the factors found in step 2.
4. Factor by grouping.

Example:
Factor $2x^2 + 7x + 3$

$ac = 2 \times 3 = 6$
Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6
1 + 6 = 7 (equal to 7)

$2x^2 + 7x + 3 = 2x^2 + x + 6x + 3$
$= x(2x + 1) + 3(2x + 1)$
$= (2x + 1)(x + 3)$

### Applying Factorization to Real-World Problems
Factorization can be used to solve various real-world problems, such as:

- Finding the dimensions of a rectangular plot of land given its area
- Calculating the number of items that can be bought with a certain amount of money
- Determining the number of equal-sized groups that can be formed from a given number of objects

[IMAGE: A rectangular plot of land with length (x + 3) m and width (x + 2) m. The area of the plot is given as $x^2 + 5x + 6$ square meters.]

Example:
A rectangular plot of land has an area of $x^2 + 5x + 6$ square meters. If the length of the plot is $(x + 3)$ meters, find the width of the plot.

Solution:
$x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 3)(x + 2)$
The width of the plot is $(x + 2)$ meters.

## Worked Examples
1. Factor $3x^2 + 15x + 18$

   $ac = 3 \times 18 = 54$
   Factors of 54: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54
   6 + 9 = 15 (equal to 15)

   $3x^2 + 15x + 18 = 3x^2 + 6x + 9x + 18$
   $= 3x(x + 2) + 9(x + 2)$
   $= (3x + 9)(x + 2)$

2. [IMAGE: A rectangular field with a perimeter of $2x^2 + 7x + 3$ meters. The field is divided into two equal parts by a fence running along its length.]

   The perimeter of a rectangular field is $2x^2 + 7x + 3$ meters. If the field is divided into two equal parts by a fence running along its length, find the dimensions of each part.

   Solution:
   $2x^2 + 7x + 3 = (2x + 1)(x + 3)$
   The length of each part is $(x + 3)$ meters, and the width of each part is $\frac{2x + 1}{2}$ meters.

3. Kofi has GH₵ 24 to buy pens and notebooks. If each pen costs GH₵ 3 and each notebook costs GH₵ 6, find the number of pens and notebooks he can buy using the factorization method.

   Let $x$ be the number of pens Kofi can buy.
   Then, the number of notebooks he can buy is $\frac{24 - 3x}{6} = 4 - \frac{x}{2}$.

   Total items bought = $x + (4 - \frac{x}{2})$
   $= x + 4 - \frac{x}{2}$
   $= \frac{2x + 8 - x}{2}$
   $= \frac{x + 8}{2}$

   To find the maximum number of items Kofi can buy, we factor the expression:
   $x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4)$

   The maximum value of $(x + 2)(x + 4)$ occurs when $x = 1$.

   So, Kofi can buy 1 pen and 3 notebooks.

## Practice Problems
1. Factor $5x^2 + 17x + 6$.
2. Factor $4x^2 - 12x + 9$.
3. The area of a rectangular garden is $6x^2 + 5x - 4$ square meters. If the length of the garden is $(3x - 1)$ meters, find its width.
4. Ama has GH₵ 36 to buy oranges and mangoes. If each orange costs GH₵ 4 and each mango costs GH₵ 9, find the number of oranges and mangoes she can buy using the factorization method.

Answers:
1. $(5x + 3)(x + 2)$
2. $(2x - 3)^2$
3. $(2x + 4)$ meters
4. 3 oranges and 3 mangoes
