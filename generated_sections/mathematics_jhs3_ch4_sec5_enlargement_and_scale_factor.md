2. Identify the center of enlargement and calculate scale factors
3. Perform enlargements on 2D shapes using positive and fractional scale factors
4. Solve problems involving enlargement and scale factor in real-world contexts

## Introduction
In our daily lives, we often encounter situations where we need to resize objects or images. For example, when a seamstress in Kumasi Market wants to create a larger version of a dress pattern, she uses the concept of enlargement and scale factor to ensure the proportions remain the same. Similarly, when an architect in Accra designs a scale model of a new building, they use enlargement to create a smaller version while maintaining the relative sizes of the building's features.

Understanding enlargement and scale factor is also crucial for your success in the BECE mathematics exam. These concepts are frequently tested, and mastering them will help you solve problems efficiently and accurately. In this section, we will explore the mathematical principles behind enlargement and scale factor, and apply them to real-world situations in Ghana.

## Main Content
### What is Enlargement?
**Enlargement** is a transformation that changes the size of a shape while maintaining its proportions. When a shape is enlarged, all its lengths are multiplied by a constant value called the **scale factor**. The enlarged shape is similar to the original shape, meaning that corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are proportional.

### Center of Enlargement and Scale Factor
The **center of enlargement** is the point from which the enlargement takes place. It can be located inside, outside, or on the boundary of the shape. The **scale factor** (SF) is the ratio of the lengths of the enlarged shape to the lengths of the original shape. It is expressed as a positive number or fraction.

The scale factor can be calculated using the following formula:

$SF = \frac{\text{Length of enlarged shape}}{\text{Length of original shape}}$

### Performing Enlargements
To perform an enlargement, follow these steps:
1. Identify the center of enlargement and the scale factor
2. For each point of the original shape:
   - Draw a line from the center of enlargement to the point
   - Multiply the distance from the center to the point by the scale factor
   - Measure the new distance along the line and mark the enlarged point
3. Connect the enlarged points to form the enlarged shape

The effects of different scale factors on enlargement are summarized in this table:

| Scale Factor (SF) | Effect on Enlargement |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| SF > 1            | Enlargement (shape size increases) |
| 0 < SF < 1        | Reduction (shape size decreases) |
| SF = 1            | No change (shape remains the same) |

### Properties of Enlargement
Enlargement has several important properties:
- Enlargement preserves shape (similar figures)
- Corresponding angles are equal
- Corresponding sides are proportional
- Area and volume are multiplied by the square and cube of the scale factor, respectively

## Worked Examples
1. A map of a farm in the Volta Region has a scale of 1:5000. If the length of a field on the map is 6 cm, what is the actual length of the field in meters?

   [IMAGE: Diagram of the map and the actual field with lengths marked]

   Solution:
   - The scale is 1:5000, so the scale factor is $\frac{1}{5000}$
   - Let the actual length of the field be $x$ meters
   - Using the scale factor formula: $\frac{1}{5000} = \frac{6}{x}$
   - Cross-multiply: $1 \cdot x = 5000 \cdot 6$
   - Solve for $x$: $x = \frac{5000 \cdot 6}{1} = 30,000$
   - The actual length of the field is 30,000 cm = 300 m

2. A seamstress in Tamale wants to enlarge a dress pattern by a scale factor of 1.25. If the original pattern has a width of 80 cm, what will be the width of the enlarged pattern?

   Solution:
   - The scale factor is 1.25
   - Original width = 80 cm
   - Enlarged width = Original width × Scale factor
   - Enlarged width = 80 cm × 1.25 = 100 cm

3. A scale model of a new stadium in Cape Coast has a scale factor of $\frac{1}{200}$. If the height of the model is 15 cm, calculate the actual height of the stadium in meters.

   Solution:
   - The scale factor is $\frac{1}{200}$
   - Model height = 15 cm
   - Let the actual height be $h$ meters
   - Using the scale factor formula: $\frac{1}{200} = \frac{15}{h}$
   - Cross-multiply: $1 \cdot h = 200 \cdot 15$
   - Solve for $h$: $h = \frac{200 \cdot 15}{1} = 3000$
   - The actual height of the stadium is 3000 cm = 30 m

## Practice Problems
1. A photograph of a famous landmark in Kumasi has a scale factor of 0.02. If the actual height of the landmark is 50 meters, what is the height of the landmark in the photograph? [Answer: 1 cm]

2. A scale drawing of a rectangular classroom has a length of 10 cm and a width of 6 cm. If the actual length of the classroom is 8 meters, find the scale factor and the actual width of the classroom. [Answer: Scale factor = 1:80, Actual width = 4.8 m]

3. A map of a national park in Ghana has a scale of 1:100,000. If the distance between two points on the map is 5 cm, calculate the actual distance between the points in kilometers. [Answer: 5 km]
