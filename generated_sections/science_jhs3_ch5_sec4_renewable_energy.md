## Introduction
Imagine a world where the energy we use comes from sources that never run out - the sun, the wind, and even the crops we grow. This is the promise of renewable energy, a key solution to the global challenge of meeting our growing energy needs while protecting the environment. In Ghana, we are blessed with abundant renewable energy resources, from the mighty Volta River that powers the Akosombo Dam to the bright sunlight that nurtures our cocoa crops. As young scientists, it is crucial for us to understand how these renewable energy sources work and how they can contribute to a sustainable future for our country and the world.

Renewable energy is not just about science and technology; it is also closely linked to our society and economy. By harnessing renewable energy, we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, create new jobs, and promote rural development. Moreover, renewable energy can help us combat climate change, one of the greatest challenges facing our generation. As we explore the fascinating world of renewable energy in this chapter, let us think about how we can apply this knowledge to build a brighter, greener future for Ghana.

## Main Content
### Types of Renewable Energy
Renewable energy refers to energy derived from sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. The main types of renewable energy are:

1. **Solar energy**: Harnessing the sun's light and heat for electricity, heating, and cooling.
2. **Wind energy**: Using the kinetic energy of moving air to generate electricity.
3. **Hydropower**: Capturing the energy of falling or flowing water to produce electricity.
4. **Biomass energy**: Utilizing organic matter, such as crops, wood, and waste, to create heat, electricity, or fuel.

### Harnessing Renewable Energy
Each type of renewable energy is harnessed and converted into usable forms through different technologies:

#### Solar Energy
Solar energy is captured using **photovoltaic (PV) cells** or **solar thermal collectors**. PV cells convert sunlight directly into electricity through the **photoelectric effect**. Solar thermal collectors absorb the sun's heat and transfer it to a fluid, which can be used for heating or to generate electricity via a **turbine**.

Chemical reaction in a PV cell:

2hν + 2Si → 2e⁻ + 2Si⁺ (hν represents a photon)

#### Wind Energy
Wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of moving air into electrical energy. As the wind blows, it rotates the turbine blades, which spin a generator to produce electricity. The power generated depends on factors such as wind speed (v), air density (ρ), and the swept area of the blades (A).

Power (P) = ½ × ρ × A × v³

#### Hydropower
Hydropower plants capture the energy of falling or flowing water to spin turbines and generate electricity. The most common type is the **impoundment facility**, which uses a dam to store water in a reservoir. Water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it to activate a generator. Ghana's Akosombo Dam on the Volta River is an example of an impoundment hydropower facility.

#### Biomass Energy
Biomass energy is produced by burning organic matter or converting it into biofuels. Biomass sources include:

- Wood and forestry residues
- Agricultural crops and waste (e.g., sugarcane, corn, cocoa pods)
- Animal waste
- Municipal solid waste

Practical Example: Creating a small-scale biogas generator using local materials

Materials:
- Large plastic container (e.g., water storage tank)
- PVC pipes and valves
- Funnel
- Organic waste (e.g., animal manure, food scraps)
- Water

Steps:
1. Cut a hole in the container's lid and attach the funnel.
2. Connect a PVC pipe to the bottom of the container and fit it with a valve.
3. Mix organic waste and water in a 1:1 ratio and pour it into the container through the funnel.
4. Seal the container and allow the mixture to ferment for 2-4 weeks.
5. Open the valve to release the biogas, which can be used for cooking or lighting.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Renewable Energy
Renewable energy sources offer several advantages over non-renewable sources:

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Clean and environmentally friendly | Intermittent and variable supply |
| Abundant and inexhaustible | High initial costs for infrastructure |
| Reduces dependence on fossil fuels | Requires large land areas |
| Creates jobs and promotes rural development | Can have environmental impacts (e.g., habitat disruption) |

### Ghana's Renewable Energy Potential
Ghana has significant potential for renewable energy development:

| Energy Source | Potential |
|---------------|-----------|
| Solar | 4.5-5.6 kWh/m²/day |
| Wind | 5.6-7.2 m/s (average wind speed) |
| Hydro | 2,480 MW (estimated capacity) |
| Biomass | 18.8 million tonnes/year (agricultural waste) |

Currently, Ghana's renewable energy usage is dominated by hydropower, which accounts for about 40% of the country's electricity generation. The government has set a target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the national energy mix to 10% by 2030.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the power output of a wind turbine with a blade diameter of 50 meters, operating in an area with an average wind speed of 7 m/s and air density of 1.23 kg/m³.

Given:
- Blade diameter (d) = 50 m
- Average wind speed (v) = 7 m/s
- Air density (ρ) = 1.23 kg/m³

Step 1: Calculate the swept area of the blades (A)
A = π × (d/2)² = π × (50/2)² = 1,963 m²

Step 2: Apply the power equation
Power (P) = ½ × ρ × A × v³
P = ½ × 1.23 × 1,963 × 7³ = 416,683 W = 416.7 kW

2. A solar panel has a surface area of 1.5 m² and an efficiency of 18%. If the panel receives an average solar irradiance of 5 kWh/m²/day, calculate the daily electricity generation.

Given:
- Solar panel area (A) = 1.5 m²
- Solar panel efficiency (η) = 18% = 0.18
- Average solar irradiance (I) = 5 kWh/m²/day

Step 1: Calculate the daily electricity generation (E)
E = A × I × η = 1.5 × 5 × 0.18 = 1.35 kWh/day
