## Introduction
Safety at home is essential for every Ghanaian family. Emergencies can strike at any time, whether it's a fire in the kitchen of your family's chop bar, a gas leak at your auntie's seamstress shop, or an injury to your little brother while he's helping your father on the farm. By being prepared for emergencies, we can protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our livelihoods. The skills you'll learn in this lesson will serve you well in any career, whether you become an entrepreneur running your own business, a chef in a busy restaurant, or a carpenter building houses. 

## Main Content

### Creating a Family Emergency Plan
Every Ghanaian family should have an **emergency plan**. This includes:
- Identifying two ways to exit each room 
- Choosing a safe meeting place outside the home
- Designating an out-of-area contact to communicate with during an emergency
- Practicing your plan regularly so everyone knows what to do

### Assembling an Emergency Kit
An **emergency kit** contains essential supplies your family may need during a crisis. Your kit should include:

| Category | Supplies |
|----------|----------|
| Food and Water | Non-perishable food, bottled water (4L per person per day) |  
| First Aid | Bandages, antiseptic, pain relievers, prescription medications |
| Tools & Safety Items | Flashlight, extra batteries, matches, fire extinguisher, rope | 
| Sanitation & Hygiene | Toilet paper, soap, toothpaste, menstrual supplies, waste bags |
| Documents | Copies of IDs, insurance papers, medical records, family contact list |

Store your kit in an easily accessible place and check supplies every 6 months.

### Identifying and Mitigating Hazards  
Many emergencies can be prevented by identifying and fixing hazards in the home:

1. Regularly check electrical wires and plugs for damage. Replace frayed cords.
2. Store flammable items (matches, kerosene, firewood) away from heat sources. 
3. Keep cooking areas clean and never leave food unattended on the stove.
4. Fix any broken steps, loose floorboards, or unstable furniture that could cause falls.
5. Ventilate rooms when using cleaning products or chemicals. Store them out of reach of children.

### Responding to Emergencies
Knowing how to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies can save lives and property. 

**In case of fire:**
1. Yell "Fire!" to alert others and get everyone outside immediately 
2. Call emergency services (911 or 192) or local fire brigade
3. Use a fire extinguisher only if the fire is small and contained
4. If smoke is filling the room, crawl low to the nearest exit
5. Once outside, never go back into a burning building

**If you smell gas:**
1. Evacuate the building immediately, leaving doors open  
2. Do NOT use any electrical switches, appliances, or open flame
3. Call emergency services and the gas company once safely outside
4. Do not re-enter until authorities have declared it safe

**For injuries:**
1. Ensure the scene is safe before approaching an injured person
2. Call for emergency medical help if the injury is severe 
3. Perform first aid as needed (control bleeding, support broken bones, treat burns)
4. Stay with the injured person until help arrives

## Practical Activity
1. Create a family emergency plan for your household. Draw a map showing two exits from each room and pick a safe outdoor meeting spot. Share copies of the plan with all family members.

2. Assemble a basic emergency kit using a sturdy bag or plastic bin. Aim to include most of the recommended supplies. Note locally available alternatives for any items you can't find or afford. Store your kit in an accessible location.

3. Conduct a home hazard inspection. Go room by room identifying potential dangers (fire risks, trip hazards, toxic/dangerous items). Make a list of hazards found and corrective actions needed. Fix any hazards you can address immediately.

## Career Connections
The ability to identify hazards, prevent accidents, and respond effectively to emergencies is valuable in any Ghanaian workplace. For example:
- An entrepreneur running a chop bar must know fire safety to protect her kitchen and customers 
- A tailor working with electrical sewing machines and irons must be able to prevent and respond to electrical fires
- A carpenter using power tools and lifting heavy materials needs to identify hazards to avoid injuries on the job
- Any employee in a shop, office, or factory should know their workplace emergency plans and be prepared to act quickly in a crisis

## Summary
- Create and practice a family emergency plan 
- Assemble a kit with emergency supplies
- Identify and mitigate hazards in the home
- Know how to respond to fires, gas leaks, and injuries 
- Prevent workplace accidents and be prepared for emergencies on the job
