## Introduction
Kofi and Ama, two JHS 1 students from Accra, were walking home from school one day, discussing the upcoming exams. Ama mentioned that she was worried about the Maths exam because she had struggled to understand some of the concepts. Kofi, who was good at Maths, offered to help her study. However, he realised that he had a dilemma: his friends had invited him to play football at the same time he had promised to help Ama. Kofi knew that being honest and truthful was important, and he had to decide whether to keep his promise to Ama or go play with his friends.

Honesty and truthfulness are essential moral values that are highly regarded in Ghanaian society. These values are promoted by various religions, including Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African Religion. In our diverse religious landscape, with churches and mosques dotting the cities of Accra and Kumasi, and traditional shrines in rural areas, the message of honesty and truthfulness remains a common thread that binds us together.
