## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Plot points on the Cartesian plane using ordered pairs (x, y)
2. Identify the coordinates of points on the Cartesian plane
3. Calculate the distance between two points on the Cartesian plane
4. Determine the midpoint of a line segment on the Cartesian plane

## Introduction
The Cartesian plane is a fundamental concept in mathematics that allows us to represent points and shapes using coordinates. In Ghana, we use coordinate geometry in various aspects of our daily lives. For example, when you visit the market to buy groceries, the stall arrangements can be thought of as a grid system, similar to the Cartesian plane. Each stall can be located using its unique "coordinates" based on its row and column.

Another example is in mobile money transactions. When you transfer money to a friend, the mobile money app often displays a confirmation screen with a QR code. This QR code contains information about the transaction, such as the amount and the recipient's phone number, which can be represented as coordinates on a plane.

Understanding the Cartesian plane is also crucial for success in the BECE and WAEC exams. Coordinate geometry problems frequently appear in these exams, so mastering this topic will help you excel in your mathematics assessments.

## Main Content
### The Cartesian Plane
The Cartesian plane, also known as the coordinate plane, is a two-dimensional plane formed by the intersection of a horizontal number line (the x-axis) and a vertical number line (the y-axis) at right angles. The point of intersection is called the **origin** and has the coordinates (0, 0).

### Plotting Points
To plot a point on the Cartesian plane, we use an **ordered pair** (x, y), where x represents the position along the x-axis, and y represents the position along the y-axis. The first coordinate (x) is called the **abscissa**, and the second coordinate (y) is called the **ordinate**.

For example, to plot the point (3, 4):
1. Start at the origin (0, 0)
2. Move 3 units to the right along the x-axis
3. Move 4 units up parallel to the y-axis
4. Mark the point at the final position

### Distance Between Two Points
To find the distance between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) on the Cartesian plane, we use the distance formula:

Distance = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)

This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, as the distance between two points forms the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.

### Midpoint of a Line Segment
The midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the segment into two equal parts. To find the midpoint (x₀, y₀) of a line segment with endpoints (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), we use the midpoint formulas:

x₀ = (x₁ + x₂) ÷ 2
y₀ = (y₁ + y₂) ÷ 2

In other words, the midpoint coordinates are the averages of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the endpoints.

## Worked Examples
1. Plot the points A(2, 3), B(-1, 4), and C(0, -2) on the Cartesian plane.

2. Find the distance between points P(1, 5) and Q(4, 2).

Using the distance formula:
Distance = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)
= √((4 - 1)² + (2 - 5)²)
= √(3² + (-3)²)
= √(9 + 9)
= √18
= 3√2 units

3. Determine the midpoint of the line segment joining points R(-3, 6) and S(5, -2).

Using the midpoint formulas:
x₀ = (x₁ + x₂) ÷ 2 = (-3 + 5) ÷ 2 = 2 ÷ 2 = 1
y₀ = (y₁ + y₂) ÷ 2 = (6 + (-2)) ÷ 2 = 4 ÷ 2 = 2

The midpoint is (1, 2).

## Practice Problems
1. Plot the points M(3, -1), N(-2, 0), and P(0, 4) on the Cartesian plane.
2. Calculate the distance between points X(-1, 7) and Y(3, 3).
3. Find the midpoint of the line segment joining points K(-5, -3) and L(3, 5).
