# Advanced Algebra: Variation (Direct and Inverse)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of variation and its types (direct and inverse)
2. Identify direct and inverse variation from given equations or word problems
3. Set up and solve equations involving direct and inverse variation
4. Apply the concepts of direct and inverse variation to real-life situations

## Introduction
In our daily lives, we often encounter situations where quantities are related to each other. For example, when buying groceries at the market, the total cost depends on the quantity of items purchased. If you buy more items, the total cost increases. This is an example of direct variation. On the other hand, when sharing a fixed amount of money among a group of friends, the more friends there are, the less each person receives. This is an example of inverse variation.

Understanding variation is essential for solving problems in various fields, such as commerce, agriculture, and engineering. It is also crucial for Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE examination, as questions on variation frequently appear in the mathematics section.

## Main Content
### What is Variation?
**Variation** is a mathematical concept that describes the relationship between two quantities. When one quantity changes, the other quantity also changes in a specific way. There are two main types of variation: direct variation and inverse variation.

### Direct Variation
In **direct variation**, as one quantity increases, the other quantity also increases proportionally. The equation for direct variation is:

y = kx

where:
- y is the dependent variable
- x is the independent variable
- k is the constant of variation

For example, if the cost of one pen is GH₵2, then the cost of x pens is given by:

Cost = 2x

| Number of Pens (x) | Cost (y) |
|------------------|----------|
| 1                | GH₵2     |
| 2                | GH₵4     |
| 3                | GH₵6     |
| 4                | GH₵8     |

### Inverse Variation
In **inverse variation**, as one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases proportionally. The equation for inverse variation is:

y = k/x

where:
- y is the dependent variable
- x is the independent variable
- k is the constant of variation

For example, if it takes 6 workers 4 days to complete a task, then the number of days (y) it takes to complete the task is inversely proportional to the number of workers (x):

y = 24/x

| Number of Workers (x) | Number of Days (y) |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 1                     | 24                  |
| 2                     | 12                  |
| 3                     | 8                   |
| 4                     | 6                   |

### Solving Variation Problems
To solve variation problems, follow these steps:
1. Identify the type of variation (direct or inverse) from the given equation or problem description
2. Write the appropriate variation equation (y = kx for direct, y = k/x for inverse)
3. Substitute the given values into the equation
4. Solve for the unknown variable

## Worked Examples

1. The weight of a gold nugget is directly proportional to its volume. If a nugget with a volume of 5 cm³ weighs 95 grams, find the weight of a nugget with a volume of 8 cm³.

Step 1: Identify the type of variation
Direct variation (weight is directly proportional to volume)

Step 2: Write the variation equation
W = kV, where W is the weight and V is the volume

Step 3: Substitute the given values
95 = k × 5

Step 4: Solve for k
k = 95 ÷ 5 = 19

Step 5: Find the weight of the nugget with a volume of 8 cm³
W = 19 × 8 = 152 grams

2. The time taken to fill a water tank is inversely proportional to the number of pipes used. If it takes 6 hours to fill the tank using 4 pipes, how long will it take to fill the tank using 8 pipes?

Step 1: Identify the type of variation
Inverse variation (time is inversely proportional to the number of pipes)

Step 2: Write the variation equation
T = k/P, where T is the time and P is the number of pipes

Step 3: Substitute the given values
6 = k/4

Step 4: Solve for k
k = 6 × 4 = 24

Step 5: Find the time taken to fill the tank using 8 pipes
T = 24/8 = 3 hours

## Practice Problems
1. The distance traveled by a car is directly proportional to the time taken. If a car travels 120 km in 3 hours, how far will it travel in 5 hours?
2. The number of days it takes to paint a house is inversely proportional to the number of painters. If 6 painters can paint a house in 10 days, how many days will it take for 15 painters to paint the same house?
3. The current in an electrical circuit is directly proportional to the voltage. If a current of 2 amperes flows when the voltage is 12 volts, find the current when the voltage is 18 volts.

Answers:
1. 200 km
2. 4 days
3. 3 amperes
