## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Define and understand the three primary trigonometric ratios: sine, cosine, and tangent.
2. Calculate trigonometric ratios for angles in right-angled triangles.
3. Apply trigonometric ratios to solve real-life problems involving heights and distances.
4. Understand the relationship between trigonometric ratios and the sides of a right-angled triangle.

## Introduction
Trigonometry is a crucial branch of mathematics that deals with the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles. In Ghana, trigonometry has various applications in everyday life. For instance, when constructing a roof for a house, builders use trigonometric ratios to determine the pitch and the required length of roof rafters. In agriculture, farmers can use trigonometry to calculate the height of trees or the width of a river without directly measuring them. Understanding trigonometric ratios is also essential for success in the BECE and WAEC exams, as these concepts are frequently tested.

## Main Content
### Right-Angled Triangles and Trigonometric Ratios
A right-angled triangle is a triangle with one 90° angle. In a right-angled triangle, the side opposite the right angle is called the **hypotenuse**, the side adjacent to the angle being considered is called the **adjacent side**, and the side opposite the angle being considered is called the **opposite side**.

The three primary trigonometric ratios are:
1. **Sine (sin)**: Opposite / Hypotenuse
2. **Cosine (cos)**: Adjacent / Hypotenuse
3. **Tangent (tan)**: Opposite / Adjacent

### Calculating Trigonometric Ratios
To calculate trigonometric ratios, follow these steps:
1. Identify the right angle in the triangle.
2. Label the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle).
3. Identify the angle for which you want to calculate the ratio.
4. Label the opposite side (the side opposite the angle) and the adjacent side (the side next to the angle).
5. Use the appropriate ratio formula (sin, cos, or tan) to calculate the desired trigonometric ratio.

### Trigonometric Ratios and Side Lengths
If you know the length of one side of a right-angled triangle and one of the trigonometric ratios, you can calculate the lengths of the other sides using these formulas:

| Ratio | Formula for Opposite | Formula for Adjacent | Formula for Hypotenuse |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Sine  | sin θ × Hypotenuse   | √(Hypotenuse² - Opposite²) | Opposite / sin θ |
| Cosine | √(Hypotenuse² - Adjacent²) | cos θ × Hypotenuse | Adjacent / cos θ |
| Tangent | tan θ × Adjacent | Opposite / tan θ | √(Opposite² + Adjacent²) |

## Worked Examples
1. In a right-angled triangle, if the hypotenuse is 10 cm and the angle opposite the side is 30°, find the length of the opposite side.

Step 1: Identify the appropriate trigonometric ratio.
sin θ = Opposite / Hypotenuse

Step 2: Substitute the known values into the formula.
sin 30° = Opposite / 10

Step 3: Solve for the opposite side.
Opposite = sin 30° × 10
Opposite = 0.5 × 10 = 5 cm

Therefore, the length of the opposite side is 5 cm.

2. A ladder 6 meters long leans against a wall. The angle between the ladder and the ground is 72°. How high up the wall does the ladder reach?

[IMAGE: A ladder leaning against a wall, forming a right-angled triangle with the ground. The ladder is the hypotenuse, and the angle between the ladder and the ground is marked as 72°.]

Step 1: Identify the appropriate trigonometric ratio.
sin θ = Opposite / Hypotenuse

Step 2: Substitute the known values into the formula.
sin 72° = Height / 6

Step 3: Solve for the height.
Height = sin 72° × 6
Height ≈ 0.9511 × 6 ≈ 5.71 meters

Therefore, the ladder reaches approximately 5.71 meters up the wall.

3. Kofi is flying a kite. The string of the kite is 30 meters long and makes an angle of 60° with the ground. Find the height of the kite.

Step 1: Identify the appropriate trigonometric ratio.
sin θ = Opposite / Hypotenuse

Step 2: Substitute the known values into the formula.
sin 60° = Height / 30

Step 4: Solve for the height.
Height = sin 60° × 30
Height ≈ 0.8660 × 30 ≈ 25.98 meters

Therefore, the height of the kite is approximately 25.98 meters.

## Practice Problems
1. In a right-angled triangle, if the adjacent side is 4 cm and the angle is 45°, find the length of the hypotenuse.
2. A ramp 8 meters long makes an angle of 20° with the ground. How high is the top of the ramp from the ground?
3. Adwoa is standing 10 meters away from the base of a flagpole. The angle of elevation from her position to the top of the flagpole is 35°. Find the height of the flagpole.

(Answers: 1. 5.66 cm; 2. 2.74 meters; 3. 6.84 meters)

## Summary
