## Introduction
Imagine you're working at a busy shop in Makola Market, a construction site in Accra, or a hotel in Kumasi. As an employee, you have certain rights, like being paid fairly and working in a safe environment. But you also have important responsibilities to your employer, your coworkers, and your customers. Understanding these rights and responsibilities is key to succeeding in any career in Ghana, whether you dream of being an entrepreneur, a skilled tradesperson, or a hospitality professional.

Think about the small businesses you see every day - the seamstresses and tailors creating beautiful kente and batik clothing, the carpenters crafting furniture, the food sellers preparing delicious waakye and jollof rice. All of these Ghanaian workers have had to learn the proper work ethics to build a loyal customer base and a reputation for reliability. In this lesson, you'll develop the practical skills to become a valuable employee or entrepreneur in any field.
