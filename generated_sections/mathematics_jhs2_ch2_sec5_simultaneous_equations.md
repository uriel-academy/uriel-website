## Introduction
Algebra is a crucial branch of mathematics that deals with equations and variables. In your daily life in Ghana, you might encounter situations where you need to solve problems involving two or more unknowns. For example, when you go to the market to buy different types of fruits with a fixed amount of money, you need to determine how many of each fruit you can buy. This is where simultaneous equations come in handy. They help you solve problems with multiple unknowns by providing a set of equations that can be solved together.

Simultaneous equations are also essential for your BECE exam preparation. You will encounter questions that require you to solve simultaneous equations to find the values of unknown variables. By mastering the techniques for solving simultaneous equations, you will be well-prepared to tackle these questions confidently.

## Main Content
### What are Simultaneous Equations?
Simultaneous equations, also known as a system of linear equations, are two or more equations that share the same variables and are solved together to find the values of those variables. In other words, simultaneous equations are a set of equations that are true for the same values of the variables.

The general form of simultaneous equations with two variables, $x$ and $y$, is:

$a_1x + b_1y = c_1$
$a_2x + b_2y = c_2$

where $a_1$, $b_1$, $c_1$, $a_2$, $b_2$, and $c_2$ are constants.

### Solving Simultaneous Equations by Substitution
One method for solving simultaneous equations is substitution. The steps for solving simultaneous equations by substitution are:

1. Choose one of the equations and solve for one variable in terms of the other.
2. Substitute the expression for the variable in the other equation.
3. Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute the value of the solved variable back into the expression from step 1 to find the value of the other variable.

### Solving Simultaneous Equations by Elimination
Another method for solving simultaneous equations is elimination. The steps for solving simultaneous equations by elimination are:

1. Multiply one or both equations by a constant to make the coefficients of one variable equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.
2. Add the equations together to eliminate one variable.
3. Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute the value of the solved variable into one of the original equations to find the value of the other variable.

### Applying Simultaneous Equations to Real-Life Problems
Simultaneous equations can be used to solve various real-life problems. Here are some examples:

1. Currency exchange: If you have a certain amount of Ghanaian Cedis and want to exchange them for US Dollars and Euros, you can use simultaneous equations to determine how much of each currency you can get.

2. Mixing solutions: If you have two solutions with different concentrations of a substance and want to mix them to obtain a solution with a specific concentration, you can use simultaneous equations to determine the amounts of each solution needed.

3. Mobile money transactions: If you have a certain amount of money in your mobile money account and want to send different amounts to two friends, you can use simultaneous equations to determine how much money will be left in your account after the transactions.

## Worked Examples
1. Solve the following simultaneous equations by substitution:
   
   $2x + 3y = 11$
   $x - y = 1$

   [IMAGE: Graph showing the lines 2x + 3y = 11 and x - y = 1 intersecting at the point (2, 3)]

   Solution:
   From the second equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$:
   $x = y + 1$

   Substitute this into the first equation:
   $2(y + 1) + 3y = 11$
   $2y + 2 + 3y = 11$
   $5y + 2 = 11$
   $5y = 9$
   $y = \frac{9}{5} = 1.8$

   Substitute $y = 1.8$ into $x = y + 1$:
   $x = 1.8 + 1 = 2.8$

   Therefore, the solution is $x = 2.8$ and $y = 1.8$.

2. Solve the following simultaneous equations by elimination:
   
   $3x + 2y = 13$
   $2x - 3y = 1$

   Solution:
   Multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $y$ equal in magnitude but opposite in sign:
   $3x + 2y = 13$
   $4x - 6y = 2$

   Add the equations together to eliminate $y$:
   $7x = 15$
   $x = \frac{15}{7} \approx 2.14$

   Substitute $x \approx 2.14$ into the first equation to find $y$:
   $3(2.14) + 2y = 13$
   $6.42 + 2y = 13$
   $2y = 6.58$
   $y = \frac{6.58}{2} = 3.29$

   Therefore, the solution is $x \approx 2.14$ and $y \approx 3.29$.

3. Kofi and Ama went to the market to buy oranges and bananas. Kofi bought 2 oranges and 3 bananas for GH₵17, while Ama bought 3 oranges and 1 banana for GH₵13. Find the price of each orange and each banana.

   Let $x$ be the price of an orange and $y$ be the price of a banana.

   [IMAGE: Table showing the number of oranges and bananas bought by Kofi and Ama, along with the total cost]

   | Person | Oranges | Bananas | Total Cost |
   |--------|---------|---------|------------|
   | Kofi   | 2       | 3       | GH₵17      |
   | Ama    | 3       | 1       | GH₵13      |

   The simultaneous equations are:
   $2x + 3y = 17$
   $3x + y = 13$

   Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2:
   $6x + 9y = 51$
   $6x + 2y = 26$

   Subtract the second equation from the first:
   $7y = 25$
   $y = \frac{25}{7} \approx GH₵3.57$

   Substitute $y \approx 3.57$ into the second equation to find $x$:
   $3x + 3.57 = 13$
   $3x = 9.43$
   $x = \frac{9.43}{3} \approx GH₵3.14$

   Therefore, each orange costs approximately GH₵3.14, and each banana costs approximately GH₵3.57.

## Practice Problems
1. Solve the following simultaneous equations by substitution:
   $5x - 2y = 7$
   $3x + 4y = 22$

2. Solve the following simultaneous equations by elimination:
   $4x + 3y = 16$
   $2x - 5y = 6$

3. Kwame and Adwoa are selling eggs and bread at their shop. Kwame sold 4 eggs and 3 loaves of bread for GH₵22, while Adwoa sold 6 eggs and 2 loaves of bread for GH₵28. Find the price of each egg and each loaf of bread.

Answers:
1. $x = 3$, $y = 4$
2. $x = 3$, $y = 2$
3. Each egg costs GH₵4, and each loaf of bread costs GH₵2.
