## Introduction
Kofi and Ama, two JHS 2 students from Accra, were walking home from school one day discussing their RME lesson. They had learned about the importance of role models in shaping one's character and moral values. Kofi, a Christian, mentioned how he admired the teachings of Jesus Christ, while Ama, a Muslim, shared her respect for the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). They both agreed that despite their different religious backgrounds, they could learn valuable lessons from the lives of these great religious leaders.

As they passed by a mosque and a church on their way home, Kofi and Ama reflected on the religious diversity in Ghana.
