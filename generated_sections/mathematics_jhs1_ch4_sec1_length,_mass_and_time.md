### Introduction
Measurement is a fundamental aspect of mathematics that has countless applications in our daily lives. In Ghana, we encounter measurements every day, whether we are buying goods at the market, managing our mobile money accounts, or helping our families with farming tasks. By mastering the concepts of length, mass, and time, we can develop essential skills that will serve us well in both practical situations and academic pursuits, such as preparing for the BECE exams.

As we explore this topic, we will learn how to convert between different units of measurement, perform calculations involving length, mass, and time, and even determine the perimeter and area of simple shapes. These skills will not only help us excel in mathematics but also enable us to make informed decisions in our daily lives and future careers.

### Main Content
#### Units of Measurement
In Ghana, we use the **metric system** for measuring length, mass, and time. The basic units of measurement are:
- Length: **meter (m)**
- Mass: **gram (g)**
- Time: **second (s)**

To express larger or smaller quantities, we use prefixes such as kilo- (k), centi- (c), and milli- (m). For example:
- 1 kilometer (km) = 1,000 meters (m)
- 1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 meter (m)
- 1 kilogram (kg) = 1,000 grams (g)
- 1 milligram (mg) = 0.001 gram (g)

| Prefix | Abbreviation | Meaning      |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| kilo-  | k            | 1,000 times  |
| centi- | c            | 1/100 times  |
| milli- | m            | 1/1,000 times|

#### Converting Units
To convert between different units of measurement, we can use multiplication or division. For example:
- To convert 5 km to meters: 5 km × 1,000 = 5,000 m
- To convert 3,500 g to kilograms: 3,500 g ÷ 1,000 = 3.5 kg

When converting time, it's essential to remember the relationships between seconds, minutes, and hours:
- 1 minute = 60 seconds
- 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3,600 seconds

#### Perimeter and Area
Perimeter is the distance around a shape, while area is the amount of space inside a shape. To calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula:

$P = 2(l + w)$

where $P$ is the perimeter, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.

To find the area of a rectangle, we use the formula:

$A = l × w$

where $A$ is the area, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.

#### Data Interpretation
Measurements of length, mass, and time can be represented using tables and graphs. By learning to interpret and create these visual representations, we can better understand and communicate information related to measurements.

### Worked Examples
1. Kofi wants to buy a 3.5 m rope for his farm. If the rope costs GH₵1.20 per meter, how much will Kofi pay for the rope?

   Given:
   - Length of the rope = 3.5 m
   - Cost per meter = GH₵1.20

   Step 1: Calculate the total cost by multiplying the length of the rope by the cost per meter.
   Total cost = 3.5 m × GH₵1.20/m = GH₵4.20

   Therefore, Kofi will pay GH₵4.20 for the rope.

2. Ama runs a small business selling rice. She has a bag containing 50 kg of rice. If she sells the rice in 500 g packets, how many packets can she make from the bag?

   Given:
   - Total mass of rice = 50 kg
   - Mass of each packet = 500 g

   Step 1: Convert 50 kg to grams.
   50 kg = 50 × 1,000 g = 50,000 g

   Step 2: Divide the total mass of rice by the mass of each packet to find the number of packets.
   Number of packets = 50,000 g ÷ 500 g = 100

   Therefore, Ama can make 100 packets of rice from the 50 kg bag.

3. Kwame takes 45 minutes to walk to school. If he leaves home at 7:15 am, at what time will he arrive at school?

   Given:
   - Time taken to walk to school = 45 minutes
   - Departure time from home = 7:15 am

   Step 1: Add 45 minutes to the departure time.
   7:15 am + 45 minutes = 8:00 am

   Therefore, Kwame will arrive at school at 8:00 am.

### Practice Problems
1. A rectangular garden has a length of 6 m and a width of 4 m. Calculate the perimeter and area of the garden.

2. Abena bought 2.5 kg of oranges and 1.75 kg of apples. What is the total mass of the fruits she bought?

3. John spent 2 hours and 30 minutes studying mathematics. If he started studying at 4:45 pm, at what time did he finish?

Answers:
1. Perimeter = 20 m, Area = 24 m²
2. 4.25 kg
3. 7:15 pm

### Summary
- Length, mass, and time are fundamental measurements in the metric system, with basic units of meter (m), gram (g), and second (s), respectively.
- To convert between units, use multiplication or division based on the relationships between the units.
- Perimeter is the distance around a shape, while area is the space inside a shape. For rectangles, use the formulas $P = 2(l + w)$ and $A = l × w$.
- Measurements can be represented using tables and graphs, which help in understanding and communicating information.
