## Introduction
Kofi and Ama were walking home from school in Accra when they saw an elderly man begging on the street. They felt sad seeing the man's suffering and wondered why poverty and hunger persist in Ghana and around the world. In their RME class, their teacher Madam Abena has been discussing how religious and moral values compel us to care for the less fortunate. 

As students living in Ghana's diverse religious society, it's important for us to understand the teachings of Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African Religion on poverty and hunger. By learning about these global issues and how to address them, we can develop empathy, compassion, and a sense of social responsibility. Together, we can work towards a Ghana where everyone's basic needs are met.

### Religious Teachings on Caring for the Poor and Hungry
All major religions emphasize the moral obligation to help those in need:

- Christianity teaches that "whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me" (Matthew 25:40). Jesus emphasized caring for the poor and marginalized.

- Islam has the concept of **zakat**, one of the Five Pillars, which requires Muslims to give a portion of their wealth to the poor and needy. The Quran states, "And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity" (2:110).

- Traditional African Religion values **communal living** and **social responsibility**. There is a strong emphasis on sharing resources and supporting the less fortunate members of the community.

Despite theological differences, these religions share a common message of compassion, generosity, and service to others.

### Practical Ways to Address Poverty and Hunger
Individuals and communities can help alleviate poverty and hunger through:

1. Donating money, food, or resources to reputable charities and organizations
2. Volunteering time and skills to support local initiatives and projects
3. Advocating for policies and programs that address the root causes of poverty
4. Supporting fair trade, ethical consumption, and sustainable development practices
5. Promoting education and job training to break the cycle of poverty

### The Role of Empathy and Social Responsibility
Addressing global issues like poverty and hunger requires more than just material resources. It calls for a change in mindset and values:

- Developing empathy and compassion for those who are suffering
- Recognizing our shared humanity and interconnectedness
- Embracing social responsibility and the duty to contribute to the common good
- Challenging apathy, indifference, and the "not my problem" attitude

By cultivating these moral values and putting them into action, we can create a more just, caring, and sustainable world.

## Examples
1. Kwame, a Muslim student in Kumasi, organizes a food drive at his mosque during Ramadan. He collects donations from the congregation and distributes them to needy families in the community. Kwame's actions demonstrate the Islamic values of **zakat** and caring for the poor.

2. Sister Agnes, a Catholic nun in a rural village, runs a feeding program for malnourished children. She partners with local farmers and businesses to provide nutritious meals and teaches families about healthy eating habits. Sister Agnes exemplifies the Christian call to serve "the least of these."
