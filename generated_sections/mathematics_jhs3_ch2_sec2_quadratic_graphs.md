## Introduction
Algebra is a powerful tool that helps us solve complex problems in everyday life. In Ghana, quadratic functions have many applications. Market traders can use them to optimize profits by finding the ideal price and quantity of goods to sell. Farmers can model crop yields based on the amount of fertilizer used. Engineers designing roads and bridges use quadratic functions to create safe and efficient structures. As you prepare for the BECE exam, mastering quadratic graphs will give you a strong foundation in mathematics and problem-solving skills that will serve you well in any career path.

## Main Content
### Graphing Quadratic Functions
A quadratic function has the general form y = ax² + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0. To graph a quadratic function:
1. Calculate the y-intercept by setting x = 0 and solving for y.
2. Find the roots (x-intercepts) by setting y = 0 and solving the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 using the quadratic formula: 
$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
3. Determine the vertex using the formula:
$(\frac{-b}{2a}, f(\frac{-b}{2a}))$
4. Plot the y-intercept, roots, and vertex, then connect the points with a smooth curve.

### Key Features of Quadratic Graphs

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| y-intercept | The point where the graph crosses the y-axis (0, c) |
| Roots | The x-coordinates where the graph crosses the x-axis (y = 0) |
| Vertex | The turning point of the parabola (maximum or minimum) |
| Axis of symmetry | The vertical line that passes through the vertex, dividing the parabola into two equal halves |

### Solving Quadratic Equations Graphically
To solve a quadratic equation graphically:
1. Graph the quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c
2. Identify the x-coordinates of the points where the graph crosses the x-axis (the roots)
3. The solutions to the quadratic equation are the x-coordinates of the roots

### Applications of Quadratic Functions
Quadratic functions can model many real-world situations, such as:
- Profit and loss in business
- Projectile motion in physics
- Area and perimeter of geometric shapes

## Worked Examples
1. Graph the quadratic function y = x² - 6x + 5 and find its roots.

Step 1: Find the y-intercept by setting x = 0:
y = (0)² - 6(0) + 5 = 5
The y-intercept is (0, 5).

Step 2: Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula:
$a = 1, b = -6, c = 5$
$x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2-4(1)(5)}}{2(1)} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{16}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4}{2}$
$x_1 = \frac{6 + 4}{2} = 5$ and $x_2 = \frac{6 - 4}{2} = 1$
The roots are (1, 0) and (5, 0).

Step 3: Find the vertex:
$x = \frac{-b}{2a} = \frac{-(-6)}{2(1)} = 3$
$y = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 5 = 9 - 18 + 5 = -4$
The vertex is (3, -4).

Step 4: Plot the points and draw the parabola.

2. Kofi throws a ball from a height of 2 meters with an initial upward velocity of 10 m/s. The ball's height (h) in meters after t seconds is given by the function h = -4.9t² + 10t + 2. How long does it take for the ball to hit the ground?

Step 1: To find when the ball hits the ground, set h = 0:
-4.9t² + 10t + 2 = 0

Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
$a = -4.9, b = 10, c = 2$
$t = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2-4(-4.9)(2)}}{2(-4.9)} = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{139.2}}{-9.8}$
$t_1 = \frac{-10 + 11.8}{-9.8} \approx -0.18$ (ignore negative time)
$t_2 = \frac{-10 - 11.8}{-9.8} \approx 2.22$

The ball hits the ground after approximately 2.22 seconds.

3. A farmer wants to fence a rectangular field with 200 meters of fencing. Express the field's area A in terms of its width x.

Let the width be x and the length be y.
Perimeter: 2x + 2y = 200
y = 100 - x

Area: A = xy = x(100 - x) = 100x - x²
The area A in terms of width x is A = -x² + 100x.

## Practice Problems
1. Graph the function y = -2x² + 8x - 3 and state its vertex.
2. Solve the equation x² + 5x - 14 = 0 graphically.
3. The height h of a ball thrown upwards after t seconds is given by h = -5t² + 20t. What is the maximum height reached by the ball?

Answers:
1. Vertex: (2, 5)
2. x = -7 or x = 2
3. 25 meters
