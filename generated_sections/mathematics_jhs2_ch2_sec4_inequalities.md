## Learning Objectives
After studying this section, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of inequalities and their symbols (>, <, ≥, ≤)
2. Solve linear inequalities in one variable
3. Represent solutions of inequalities on a number line
4. Apply inequalities to solve real-life problems

## Introduction
Inequalities are an essential part of mathematics that help us compare quantities and make decisions in our daily lives. For example, when you go to the market in Ghana to buy ingredients for your favorite dish, you might compare prices to find the best deal. If one vendor sells a bag of rice for GH₵50 and another for GH₵45, you would choose the cheaper option, knowing that GH₵45 < GH₵50.

Inequalities are also crucial in preparing for the BECE exams. Understanding how to solve and represent inequalities will help you tackle various problems in the exam and improve your overall performance.

## Main Content

### Understanding Inequalities
An **inequality** is a mathematical statement that compares two expressions using one of the following symbols:
- Greater than (>)
- Less than (<)
- Greater than or equal to (≥)
- Less than or equal to (≤)

For example, if we compare the heights of two students, Kofi and Ama, and Kofi is 160 cm tall while Ama is 155 cm tall, we can write the inequality: Kofi's height > Ama's height, or 160 cm > 155 cm.

### Solving Linear Inequalities
To solve a linear inequality in one variable, we follow similar steps as solving linear equations, but with one important difference: when multiplying or dividing both sides of the inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the inequality symbol.

Steps to solve linear inequalities:
1. Isolate the variable on one side of the inequality by adding or subtracting the same value from both sides.
2. Multiply or divide both sides by the same positive number to eliminate any coefficients.
3. If multiplying or dividing by a negative number, reverse the inequality symbol.

For example, let's solve the inequality: 2x - 5 > 7
1. Add 5 to both sides: 2x - 5 + 5 > 7 + 5
   - Simplify: 2x > 12
2. Divide both sides by 2: 2x ÷ 2 > 12 ÷ 2
   - Simplify: x > 6

### Representing Solutions on a Number Line
The solution to an inequality can be represented on a number line. Use an open circle (○) for strict inequalities (< or >) and a closed circle (●) for inclusive inequalities (≤ or ≥). Shade the portion of the number line that satisfies the inequality.

For the previous example, x > 6, we would represent the solution on a number line as follows:

### Applying Inequalities to Real-Life Problems
Inequalities are useful in solving various real-life problems. For example, a farmer in Ghana wants to fence a rectangular field with a perimeter of at most 200 meters. If the length of the field is 60 meters, find the possible widths of the field.

Let the width be w meters.
- Perimeter of the rectangle = 2(length + width) ≤ 200
- Substitute the length: 2(60 + w) ≤ 200
- Solve the inequality:
  - 120 + 2w ≤ 200
  - 2w ≤ 80
  - w ≤ 40

Therefore, the width of the field must be less than or equal to 40 meters.

## Worked Examples

1. Solve the inequality: 3(2x - 1) ≥ 15
   - Distribute 3: 6x - 3 ≥ 15
   - Add 3 to both sides: 6x - 3 + 3 ≥ 15 + 3
     - Simplify: 6x ≥ 18
   - Divide both sides by 6: 6x ÷ 6 ≥ 18 ÷ 6
     - Simplify: x ≥ 3
   
   The solution is x ≥ 3.

2. Represent the inequality -2 < x ≤ 4 on a number line.

   [IMAGE: A number line with an open circle at -2, a closed circle at 4, and shading between -2 and 4, representing all values greater than -2 and less than or equal to 4]

3. Esi wants to buy a new phone that costs no more than GH₵1,500. She has already saved GH₵900. How much more money does she need to save to afford the phone?
   
   Let x be the additional amount Esi needs to save.
   - Total saved + additional savings ≤ phone cost
   - 900 + x ≤ 1,500
   - Subtract 900 from both sides: x ≤ 600
   
   Therefore, Esi needs to save at most GH₵600 more to afford the phone.

## Practice Problems
1. Solve the inequality: 5 - 2x < 11
2. Represent the solution of -3 ≤ 2y - 1 on a number line.
3. Kwame needs to score an average of at least 80% on his final exams to get an A grade. If he scored 85% and 78% on his first two exams, what's the lowest score he can get on his third exam to achieve an A grade?

Answers:
1. x > -3
2. [IMAGE: A number line with a closed circle at -1 and shading extending to the right of -1, representing all values greater than or equal to -1]
3. Let the third exam score be x. (85 + 78 + x) ÷ 3 ≥ 80. Solve for x: x ≥ 77. So, Kwame must score at least 77% on his third exam.

## Summary
- Inequalities compare two expressions using symbols: >, <, ≥, or ≤
- To solve linear inequalities, isolate the variable, then multiply or divide both sides by the same number (if multiplying or dividing by a negative number, reverse the inequality symbol)
- Solutions to inequalities can be represented on a number line using open or closed circles and shading
- Inequalities are useful in solving real-life problems involving comparisons and constraints
