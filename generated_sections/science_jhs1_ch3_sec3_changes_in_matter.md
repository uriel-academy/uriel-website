2. Describe the processes of melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation 
3. Explain how chemical reactions transform substances
4. Identify signs that a chemical reaction has occurred
5. Understand the conservation of matter during physical and chemical changes

## Introduction
Matter is all around us, from the air we breathe to the food we eat. In Ghana, we see changes in matter every day. Think about how the cocoa beans harvested from farms undergo changes to become the delicious chocolate we enjoy. Or consider how the water in the Volta River is transformed into electricity at the Akosombo Dam. Even our bodies experience changes, like when we sweat to cool down in Ghana's tropical climate. In this section, we'll explore the fascinating world of changes in matter, both physical and chemical, and how these changes impact our daily lives.

## Main Content

### Physical Changes
Physical changes are changes that do not alter the composition of a substance. The substance remains the same, but its appearance or form may change. Some common physical changes include:

- **Melting**: When a solid is heated, it can change into a liquid. For example, when you heat solid cocoa butter, it melts into a liquid.

- **Freezing**: The opposite of melting, freezing occurs when a liquid cools and turns into a solid. Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) to form ice.

- **Evaporation**: This is when a liquid changes into a gas. In Ghana, we often see water evaporating from the surface of the Volta Lake, forming clouds in the sky.

- **Condensation**: When a gas cools and turns into a liquid, we call it condensation. You might see condensation on a cold glass of refreshing coconut water on a hot day.

### Chemical Changes
Chemical changes, also called chemical reactions, occur when one or more substances are transformed into new substances with different properties. During a chemical reaction, atoms or molecules rearrange, break apart, or combine to form new substances. Signs that a chemical reaction has occurred include:

1. Change in color
2. Formation of a precipitate (solid)
3. Production of gas bubbles
4. Release or absorption of energy (heat, light, or sound)

Here are some examples of chemical changes:
- Rusting of iron: 
4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃

- Photosynthesis in plants:
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

- Fermentation of cocoa beans:
C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose) → 2C₂H₅OH (ethanol) + 2CO₂

### Conservation of Matter
In both physical and chemical changes, matter is neither created nor destroyed. This principle is known as the **law of conservation of matter**. During a physical change, the substance remains the same, so the total mass does not change. In a chemical reaction, the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products.

### Practical Example: Rusting of Iron Nails
You can observe a chemical change using materials found in Ghana. 

Materials:
- 2 iron nails
- 2 clear plastic cups
- Water
- Vegetable oil

Procedure:
1. Fill one cup with water and the other with vegetable oil.
2. Place one iron nail in each cup.
3. Observe the nails every day for a week, noting any changes.

The nail in the water will rust (form iron oxide) due to a chemical reaction with oxygen dissolved in the water. The nail in the oil will not rust because oil does not contain dissolved oxygen.

## Worked Examples

1. A 50 g sample of water is heated until it completely evaporates. How much water vapor is produced?
   
   Answer: 50 g of water vapor. During evaporation, the total mass remains constant, so the mass of the water vapor equals the original mass of the liquid water.

2. A piece of wood weighing 100 g is burned in air, producing 5 g of ash. What is the mass of the gases released during the reaction?
   
   Answer: 95 g of gases released. Using the law of conservation of mass:
   Mass of wood = Mass of ash + Mass of gases
   100 g = 5 g + Mass of gases
   Mass of gases = 100 g - 5 g = 95 g

## Summary
- Physical changes alter the appearance or form of a substance without changing its composition.
- Common physical changes include melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation.
- Chemical changes, or reactions, transform one or more substances into new substances with different properties.
- Signs of a chemical reaction include changes in color, formation of a precipitate, production of gas bubbles, and release or absorption of energy.
- The law of conservation of matter states that matter is neither created nor destroyed during physical or chemical changes.
