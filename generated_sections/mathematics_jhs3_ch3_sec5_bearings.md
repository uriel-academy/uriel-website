## Introduction
In Ghana, understanding bearings is essential for various aspects of life. For example, farmers use bearings to determine the direction of their crops and the layout of their farms. When traveling between cities like Accra and Kumasi, bearings help in navigation and finding the shortest route. In the military and aviation sectors, bearings are crucial for accurate direction and location. As students prepare for the BECE exams, mastering bearings will not only help them excel in their mathematics papers but also develop practical skills for their future careers.

Bearings are a way of expressing the direction of one point relative to another. They are measured in degrees clockwise from north, which is considered as 0° or 360°. East is 90°, south is 180°, and west is 270°. Bearings are typically written in three digits, with values ranging from 000° to 359°.

## Main Content
### Measuring and Drawing Bearings
To measure bearings, we use a protractor. A protractor is a semi-circular device with angle markings from 0° to 180°. To measure the bearing of point B from point A:
1. Place the center of the protractor on point A.
2. Align the 0° mark with the north direction.
3. Find the angle where the line from A to B intersects the protractor scale.
4. Read the angle in degrees, which is the bearing of B from A.

To draw a bearing from point A:
1. Draw a north line from point A.
2. Place the center of the protractor on point A and align the 0° mark with the north line.
3. Make a mark at the desired bearing angle on the protractor scale.
4. Remove the protractor and draw a line from point A through the marked angle.

### Converting Between Compass Directions and Bearings
Compass directions are another way of expressing direction, using the cardinal points: North (N), East (E), South (S), and West (W). To convert between compass directions and bearings, use the following table:

| Compass Direction | Bearing |
|-------------------|---------|
| North (N)         | 000°    |
| East (E)          | 090°    |
| South (S)         | 180°    |
| West (W)          | 270°    |

For intermediate directions, add or subtract the corresponding angles. For example:
- Northeast (NE): 000° + 45° = 045°
- Southwest (SW): 180° + 45° = 225°

### Solving Bearing Problems
To solve problems involving bearings, follow these steps:
1. Identify the given information, such as points, distances, and bearings.
2. Draw a sketch of the situation, including a north line and the given bearings.
3. Use the properties of angles and triangles to find the missing information.
4. Apply the appropriate formulas or techniques to calculate the required values.

### Properties of Bearings
- Opposite Bearing: The bearing of A from B is always 180° different from the bearing of B from A.
- Sum of Angles in a Triangle: The sum of the three angles in a triangle is always 180°.
- Parallel Lines: If two lines are parallel, their bearings differ by 180°.

## Worked Examples
1. A ship sails from port A on a bearing of 065° for 12 km to reach port B. From port B, the ship sails on a bearing of 200° for 15 km to reach port C. Calculate the bearing of port A from port C.

Step 1: Draw a sketch of the situation, including the north line and the given bearings.
Step 2: Identify the angle between the bearings of port A from port B and port B from port C.
Angle ABC = 200° - 065° = 135°

Step 3: Use the sum of angles in a triangle to find the angle between the bearings of port C from port B and port A from port C.
Angle ACB = 180° - 135° = 45°

Step 4: Calculate the bearing of port A from port C by adding the angle ACB to the bearing of port B from port C.
Bearing of port A from port C = 200° + 45° = 245°

Therefore, the bearing of port A from port C is 245°.

2. Kofi is standing at a point P. He walks 3 km on a bearing of 040° to point Q, then 4 km on a bearing of 130° to point R. Calculate the distance and bearing of point R from point P.

[IMAGE: Sketch of the situation with points P, Q, and R, and the given bearings and distances]

Step 1: Draw a sketch of the situation, including the north line and the given bearings.
Step 2: Apply the cosine rule to find the distance between points P and R.
$PR^2 = PQ^2 + QR^2 - 2 \cdot PQ \cdot QR \cdot \cos(\angle PQR)$
$\angle PQR = 130° - 040° = 90°$
$PR^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 - 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot \cos(90°)$
$PR^2 = 9 + 16 - 0 = 25$
$PR = \sqrt{25} = 5$ km

Step 3: Use the sine rule to find the angle between PQ and PR.
$\frac{\sin(\angle QPR)}{QR} = \frac{\sin(90°)}{PR}$
$\sin(\angle QPR) = \frac{4 \cdot \sin(90°)}{5} = \frac{4}{5}$
$\angle QPR = \arcsin(\frac{4}{5}) \approx 53.13°$

Step 4: Calculate the bearing of point R from point P by adding the angle QPR to the bearing of point Q from point P.
Bearing of point R from point P = 040° + 53.13° = 093.13° ≈ 093°

Therefore, the distance between points P and R is 5 km, and the bearing of point R from point P is approximately 093°.

## Practice Problems
1. A plane flies from airport A to airport B on a bearing of 120° for 500 km. It then flies to airport C on a bearing of 240° for 300 km. Calculate the bearing and distance of airport C from airport A.

Answers:
1. Bearing: 156.31° ≈ 156°, Distance: 583.10 km ≈ 583 km
2. Distance: 2.6 km, Bearing: 096.59° ≈ 097°
