## Introduction
Matter is all around us, from the air we breathe to the food we eat and the objects we use daily. In Ghana, matter plays a crucial role in various aspects of life. For example, cocoa farmers rely on the properties of matter to grow and harvest quality cocoa beans, which are then processed into delicious chocolate. The Akosombo Dam on the Volta River uses the properties of water to generate hydroelectric power for the country. Even our bodies are composed of matter, and understanding its properties can help us prevent and treat diseases common in Ghana, such as malaria and typhoid fever.

In this section, we will explore the fascinating world of matter and its properties. We will learn about the three states of matter, the difference between physical and chemical properties, and how matter is conserved during changes. By the end of this section, you will have a solid foundation in the properties of matter and how they apply to everyday life in Ghana.

## Main Content
### States of Matter
Matter exists in three main states: solid, liquid, and gas. The state of matter depends on the strength of the attractive forces between particles and the amount of energy they possess.

1. **Solids**: In solids, particles are closely packed and have strong attractive forces between them. This gives solids a definite shape and volume. Examples of solids include rocks, wood, and metals like gold and aluminum.

2. **Liquids**: In liquids, particles have weaker attractive forces between them compared to solids. Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. Examples of liquids include water, palm oil, and petrol.

3. **Gases**: In gases, particles have very weak attractive forces between them and are far apart. Gases have no definite shape or volume and will fill any container they occupy. Examples of gases include air, helium, and carbon dioxide.

### Physical and Chemical Properties
Matter has both physical and chemical properties that help us identify and characterize different substances.

**Physical properties** are characteristics that can be observed or measured without changing the composition of the substance. Examples of physical properties include:
- Color
- Texture
- Melting point
- Boiling point
- Density

**Chemical properties** describe how a substance reacts with other substances to form new substances. Examples of chemical properties include:
- Flammability
- Reactivity with acids or bases
- Corrosiveness
- Oxidation

### Conservation of Matter
The law of conservation of matter states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This means that the total mass of matter remains constant during physical and chemical changes.

**Physical changes** do not alter the composition of a substance, only its physical properties. Examples of physical changes include:
- Cutting paper
- Melting ice
- Dissolving sugar in water

**Chemical changes** involve the formation of new substances with different chemical properties. Examples of chemical changes include:
- Rusting of iron
- Burning of wood
- Cooking an egg

### Density
Density is a physical property of matter that describes the amount of mass per unit volume of a substance. It is calculated using the formula:

Density = Mass ÷ Volume

The SI unit for density is kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³). However, for convenience, we often use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³) for solids and liquids, and grams per liter (g/L) for gases.

Here are some examples of densities of common substances:

| Substance | Density (g/cm³) |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Water     | 1.00            |
| Ice       | 0.92            |
| Gold      | 19.30           |
| Aluminum  | 2.70            |
| Wood      | 0.70-0.90       |

Practical Example: Determining the Density of a Local Wood Sample
1. Cut a small rectangular block of wood from a local tree, such as mahogany or ebony.
2. Measure the length, width, and height of the block using a ruler. Calculate the volume using the formula: Volume = Length × Width × Height.
3. Measure the mass of the block using a balance or scale.
4. Calculate the density of the wood sample using the formula: Density = Mass ÷ Volume.
5. Compare your result with the known densities of different wood types to identify the wood sample.

## Worked Examples
1. A gold nugget has a mass of 585 g and a volume of 30.3 cm³. Calculate its density.

Density = Mass ÷ Volume
Density = 585 g ÷ 30.3 cm³
Density = 19.3 g/cm³

2. A rectangular block of aluminum has a length of 10 cm, a width of 5 cm, and a height of 2 cm. If the block has a mass of 270 g, calculate its density.

Volume = Length × Width × Height
Volume = 10 cm × 5 cm × 2 cm
Volume = 100 cm³

Density = Mass ÷ Volume
Density = 270 g ÷ 100 cm³
Density = 2.7 g/cm³

## Summary
- Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas, which differ in the arrangement and behavior of their particles.
- Physical properties can be observed or measured without changing the composition of a substance, while chemical properties describe how a substance reacts with others.
- The law of conservation of matter states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed during physical and chemical changes.
- Density is a physical property that describes the amount of mass per unit volume of a substance, calculated using the formula: Density = Mass ÷ Volume.
- Practical applications of the properties of matter can be found in various aspects of life in Ghana, such as cocoa farming, hydroelectric power generation, and disease prevention.
