## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Identify common metal materials used in Ghana and their properties
2. Use basic metalworking tools safely and effectively
3. Create a simple metal product using cutting, bending, and joining techniques
4. Evaluate the quality of their finished metalwork product

## Introduction
Metal is all around us in Ghana, from the pots and pans used by food sellers to make delicious waakye and jollof, to the sturdy metal gates and window frames made by skilled metalworkers. Many everyday items we use, like furniture, bicycles, and even the coins in our pockets, are made from metal. Learning about metalworking can open up exciting career opportunities, whether you want to start your own metalworking business or work for a company that makes metal products. In this lesson, we'll explore the basics of metalworking and create a simple metal product using tools and techniques commonly used in Ghana.

## Main Content
### Types of Metal Materials
In Ghana, some common metal materials used for crafts and manufacturing include:
- **Mild steel**: Strong, durable, and easy to work with; used for gates, window frames, and furniture
- **Aluminum**: Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and recyclable; used for pots, pans, and roofing sheets
- **Copper**: Excellent conductor of heat and electricity; used for electrical wiring and decorative items
- **Brass**: Attractive gold-like appearance; used for doorknobs, taps, and decorative objects

### Basic Metalworking Tools
To work with metal effectively and safely, you'll need the following tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Hacksaw | Cutting metal into smaller pieces |
| File | Smoothing rough edges and shaping metal |
| Hammer | Shaping and bending metal |
| Pliers | Gripping, bending, and cutting wire |
| Measuring tape | Measuring lengths accurately |
| Scriber | Marking lines on metal for cutting or bending |
| Safety glasses | Protecting eyes from metal debris |
| Work gloves | Protecting hands from sharp edges and heat |

### Creating a Simple Metal Product
In this example, we'll create a simple metal bookmark using aluminum sheet metal.

1. Cut a rectangle of aluminum sheet metal using a hacksaw. The size can be approximately 15cm x 5cm, but you can adjust this based on your preference.
2. Use a file to smooth the cut edges of the aluminum rectangle.
3. Use pliers to bend one end of the rectangle into a decorative shape, such as a curve or a zigzag.
4. Optional: Use a hammer and a scriber to add a decorative pattern or texture to the bookmark.
5. Use a file to smooth any rough edges created during the bending and decorating process.

Remember to wear safety glasses and work gloves throughout the metalworking process to protect yourself from injury.

## Practical Activity
Create a simple aluminum coaster for a drinking glass, using the following steps:
1. Cut a square of aluminum sheet metal, approximately 10cm x 10cm, using a hacksaw.
2. File the edges of the square to make them smooth.
3. Use a scriber to draw a decorative pattern on the surface of the aluminum square.
4. Use a hammer to gently tap along the scribed lines to create a raised pattern on the coaster.
5. Optional: Bend the edges of the coaster slightly upward using pliers to create a rim that will prevent a glass from slipping off.

Materials needed:
- Aluminum sheet metal
- Hacksaw
- File
- Scriber
- Hammer
- Pliers
- Safety glasses
- Work gloves

Expected outcome: A decorative aluminum coaster with a raised pattern and slightly raised edges.

## Career Connections
