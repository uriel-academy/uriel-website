## Introduction
Finishing techniques are essential skills for anyone interested in sewing and clothing construction in Ghana. Whether you dream of becoming a fashion designer creating stylish outfits with Ghanaian fabrics like kente and batik, or hope to work as a tailor altering and repairing garments, mastering finishing techniques will ensure your clothing looks professional and lasts a long time. Many Ghanaian entrepreneurs have built successful businesses in the fashion industry thanks to their excellent garment construction skills. From small tailoring shops to large clothing manufacturers, there are many opportunities to turn your passion for sewing into a profitable career in Ghana.

## Main Content

### Hems and Seam Finishes
**Hems** are used to finish the raw edges at the bottom of garments like dresses, skirts, and pants. There are several types of hems:
- **Turned hem**: Fold fabric edge twice and stitch. Good for light to medium-weight fabrics.  
- **Faced hem**: Attach a separate strip of fabric to the edge. Best for bulky fabrics.
- **Blind hem**: Provides an invisible finish, often used on skirts and dress pants.

**Seam finishes** prevent fabric edges from fraying on the inside of garments:
- **Zigzag stitch**: Sew a zigzag along the raw edge. Quick and easy.
- **Turned and stitched**: Turn under the seam allowance and stitch. Durable finish.
- **Bias-bound**: Encase the raw edge with bias tape. Gives a clean finish.

### Sewing on Fasteners
Fasteners like buttons, hooks, and snaps are used to close openings on garments.

To sew on a button:
1. Mark the button placement on the fabric. 
2. Thread a needle with a double strand of thread and knot the end.
3. Bring the needle up through the fabric and one button hole. Place a pin across the top of the button.
4. Take the needle down through the opposite hole. Repeat several times.
5. Remove the pin and wind the thread tightly around the stitches under the button to form a shank. Knot off on the underside.

Other common fasteners include:
- Hooks and eyes
- Snap fasteners 
- Velcro

| Fastener | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| Buttons | Shirts, dresses, pants |  
| Hooks and eyes | Waistbands, bras |
| Snaps | Baby clothes, bags |
| Velcro | Adaptive clothing, kids' shoes |

### Pressing 
Proper pressing helps garments look crisp and professional. Use these tips:
- **Choose the right temperature** for the fabric. Check the garment label.
- Use a **press cloth** between the iron and fabric to prevent damage.
- **Press, don't iron**. Lift the iron up and down rather than pushing it back and forth.
- Press **seams and darts** flat first for sharper edges and points.
- Hang or fold garments **immediately after pressing** to prevent wrinkling.

### Quality Control
Before calling a garment finished, check it over carefully:
- Are the hems and seams secure with no loose threads?
- Are fasteners sewn on straight and tightly?  
- Is the garment pressed crisply with no wrinkles or shiny marks?
- Does it match the measurements of the pattern or customer?

Mark any areas that need fixes or further attention. A careful final inspection ensures every garment you make meets a high standard of quality.

## Practical Activity
### Upcycle a Men's Shirt into an Apron
Make a functional apron for cooking or selling food by repurposing an old men's button-down shirt. This project practices hemming, seam finishing, and working with buttons.

Materials:
- Men's button-down shirt (adult size)
- Matching thread 
- Pins
- Scissors
- Sewing machine
- Iron and ironing board

Instructions:
1. Cut the shirt straight across under the armpits and sleeves. Cut off the collar and cuffs.
2. Fold the raw edges under twice to hem. Pin and sew the hems.
3. Finish the side seams of the apron with a zigzag stitch or other seam finish.
4. Use the collar and cuffs to make waist ties and a neck loop. Attach securely.
5. Press the finished apron, making crisp edges and flattening the seams.

The finished apron will have a bib to protect clothing with built-in waist ties and a neck loop. Students can customize their aprons by adding pockets or trims. Have students model their completed aprons and assess the quality of construction.
