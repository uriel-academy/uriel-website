## Section: Probability Scale

### Learning Objectives
After completing this section, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of probability and its relation to real-life events
2. Express probability as a fraction, decimal, or percentage
3. Identify the probability scale and its range from 0 to 1

### Introduction
Probability is a crucial concept in mathematics that helps us understand the likelihood of events occurring in our daily lives. In Ghana, we encounter situations involving probability every day, from the chances of winning a game of ampe to the likelihood of a good harvest based on weather patterns. Understanding probability is also essential for making informed decisions, such as choosing the best mobile money provider based on their reliability and security.

As you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering probability will not only help you solve mathematical problems but also develop critical thinking skills that will serve you well in various aspects of life. In this section, we will explore the probability scale and learn how to express probability in different forms.

### Main Content
#### Understanding Probability
**Probability** is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means an event is impossible, and 1 means an event is certain to happen. The closer the probability is to 1, the more likely the event is to occur.

#### Expressing Probability
Probability can be expressed in three forms:
1. **Fraction**: The number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if there are 4 red marbles and 6 blue marbles in a bag, the probability of picking a red marble is $\frac{4}{10}$.
2. **Decimal**: The probability expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1. In the previous example, the probability of picking a red marble is 0.4.
3. **Percentage**: The probability expressed as a percentage between 0% and 100%. In the example, the probability of picking a red marble is 40%.

#### The Probability Scale
The **probability scale** is a visual representation of the range of probabilities from 0 to 1. It helps us compare the likelihoods of different events.

#### Converting Between Probability Forms
To convert between probability forms, follow these steps:
1. Fraction to decimal: Divide the numerator by the denominator.
2. Decimal to percentage: Multiply the decimal by 100 and add the % symbol.
3. Percentage to decimal: Divide the percentage by 100.
4. Decimal to fraction: Write the decimal as a fraction over 100 and simplify if possible.

| Conversion | Formula | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Fraction to decimal | $\frac{numerator}{denominator} = decimal$ | $\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$ |
| Decimal to percentage | $decimal \times 100 = percentage\%$ | $0.75 \times 100 = 75\%$ |
| Percentage to decimal | $percentage\% \div 100 = decimal$ | $75\% \div 100 = 0.75$ |
| Decimal to fraction | $decimal = \frac{decimal \times 100}{100}$ | $0.75 = \frac{75}{100} = \frac{3}{4}$ |

### Worked Examples
1. Kofi has a bag containing 3 red balls and 5 blue balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting a red ball from the bag?

   Total number of balls = 3 (red) + 5 (blue) = 8
   Probability of selecting a red ball = $\frac{3}{8}$ = 0.375 = 37.5%

2. Ama spins a spinner with 4 equal sections colored yellow, green, blue, and red. What is the probability of the spinner landing on green?

   [IMAGE: A circular spinner divided into 4 equal parts, labeled yellow, green, blue, and red.]

   Total number of sections = 4
   Probability of landing on green = $\frac{1}{4}$ = 0.25 = 25%

3. In a class of 30 students, 18 prefer football, and the rest prefer basketball. Express the probability of randomly selecting a student who prefers basketball as a fraction, decimal, and percentage.

   Number of students who prefer basketball = 30 - 18 = 12
   Probability of selecting a student who prefers basketball:
   - Fraction: $\frac{12}{30} = \frac{2}{5}$
   - Decimal: $\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$
   - Percentage: $0.4 \times 100 = 40\%$

### Practice Problems
1. A die is rolled. What is the probability of getting an even number?
2. In a bag of 20 marbles, 7 are red, 6 are blue, and 7 are green. If a marble is randomly selected, what is the probability of picking a blue marble? Express your answer as a fraction and a percentage.
3. Kwame has a deck of 52 cards. He draws a card at random. What is the probability of getting a heart? Express your answer as a decimal.

Answers:
1. $\frac{1}{2}$ or 0.5 or 50%
2. Fraction: $\frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10}$, Percentage: 30%
3. 0.25

### Summary
- Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
- Probability can be expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage.
- The probability scale visually represents the range of probabilities from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).
- To convert between probability forms, use the following formulas:
  - Fraction to decimal: $\frac{numerator}{denominator} = decimal$
  - Decimal to percentage: $decimal \times 100 = percentage\%$
  - Percentage to decimal: $percentage\% \div 100 = decimal$
  - Decimal to fraction: $decimal = \frac{decimal \times 100}{100}$
- Solving probability problems involves determining the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.
