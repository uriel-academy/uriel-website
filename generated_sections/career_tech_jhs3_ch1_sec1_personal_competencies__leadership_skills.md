When organizing a team, consider each member's strengths and weaknesses, and allocate tasks accordingly.

### Conflict Resolution and Decision-Making
Conflicts are inevitable in any team, and leaders must be able to resolve them effectively. Key steps in conflict resolution include:
1. Identify the source of the conflict
2. Listen to all parties involved
3. Find a fair and mutually acceptable solution
4. Implement the solution and monitor its effectiveness

| Conflict Resolution Strategies | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| Compromise                    | Each party gives up something to reach a middle ground |
| Collaboration                 | Parties work together to find a solution that satisfies everyone |
| Accommodation                 | One party gives in to the other to resolve the conflict |

Leaders must also be able to make difficult decisions when necessary. To make effective decisions:
1. Gather all relevant information
2. Consider all possible options and their consequences
3. Choose the best option based on your goals and values
4. Communicate your decision clearly to your team
