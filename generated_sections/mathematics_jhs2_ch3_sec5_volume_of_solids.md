# Chapter 3: Geometry and Mensuration
## Section: Volume of Solids

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Identify and differentiate between various 3D solids (cubes, cuboids, cylinders, cones, spheres)
2. Apply the appropriate formulas to calculate the volume of different solids
3. Solve real-life problems involving the volume of solids

## Introduction
In our daily lives, we encounter various three-dimensional objects, from the containers we use to store food and water to the buildings we live and work in. Understanding how to calculate the volume of these objects is crucial for many real-life applications. For example, a farmer in Ghana may need to determine the amount of water a cylindrical tank can hold to irrigate their crops efficiently. Market traders often need to estimate the volume of goods they can store in their stalls or transport in boxes. As you prepare for your BECE exams, mastering the concepts of volume will not only help you succeed academically but also equip you with practical skills for everyday life and future careers.

## Main Content
### Types of Solids
In this section, we will focus on the following 3D solids:
- **Cubes**: A solid with six equal square faces
- **Cuboids**: A solid with six rectangular faces
- **Cylinders**: A solid with two circular bases connected by a curved surface
- **Cones**: A solid with a circular base and a single vertex at the top
- **Spheres**: A solid with a curved surface, where all points are equidistant from the center

### Formulas for Volume
To calculate the volume of solids, we use the following formulas:

| Solid   | Formula                           |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| Cube    | $V = s^3$                         |
| Cuboid  | $V = l \times w \times h$         |
| Cylinder| $V = \pi r^2 h$                   |
| Cone    | $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$       |
| Sphere  | $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$         |

where:
- $V$ is the volume
- $s$ is the length of a side (cube)
- $l$ is the length (cuboid)
- $w$ is the width (cuboid)
- $h$ is the height
- $r$ is the radius
- $\pi$ is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159)

### Unit Conversion
Volume is typically measured in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm³), cubic meters (m³), or liters (L). To convert between units, use the following relationships:
- 1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³
- 1 m³ = 1,000 L
- 1 L = 1,000 cm³

### Solving Volume Problems
When solving volume problems, follow these steps:
1. Identify the type of solid
2. Determine the necessary measurements (e.g., length, width, height, radius)
3. Substitute the values into the appropriate formula
4. Calculate the volume
5. Convert to the desired unit if necessary

## Worked Examples
1. A cylindrical water tank has a radius of 1.5 m and a height of 4 m. Calculate its volume in cubic meters.

[IMAGE: Cylindrical water tank with radius (r) and height (h) labeled]

Given:
- Radius (r) = 1.5 m
- Height (h) = 4 m

Formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$

Substituting the values:
$V = \pi \times (1.5)^2 \times 4$
$V \approx 3.14159 \times 2.25 \times 4$
$V \approx 28.27 \text{ m}^3$

Therefore, the volume of the cylindrical water tank is approximately 28.27 cubic meters.

2. A market trader has a cuboid-shaped stall with a length of 2.5 m, a width of 1.8 m, and a height of 2.2 m. Calculate the volume of the stall in cubic meters.

[IMAGE: Cuboid-shaped market stall with length (l), width (w), and height (h) labeled]

Given:
- Length (l) = 2.5 m
- Width (w) = 1.8 m
- Height (h) = 2.2 m

Formula for the volume of a cuboid: $V = l \times w \times h$

Substituting the values:
$V = 2.5 \times 1.8 \times 2.2$
$V = 9.9 \text{ m}^3$

Therefore, the volume of the market trader's stall is 9.9 cubic meters.

3. A cone-shaped pile of maize has a radius of 2 m and a height of 3 m. Calculate the volume of the maize pile in cubic meters.

[IMAGE: Cone-shaped pile with radius (r) and height (h) labeled]

Given:
- Radius (r) = 2 m
- Height (h) = 3 m

Formula for the volume of a cone: $V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$

Substituting the values:
$V = \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times (2)^2 \times 3$
$V \approx \frac{1}{3} \times 3.14159 \times 4 \times 3$
$V \approx 12.57 \text{ m}^3$

Therefore, the volume of the cone-shaped maize pile is approximately 12.57 cubic meters.

## Practice Problems
1. Calculate the volume of a cube with a side length of 5 cm.
2. A rectangular water tank has a length of 2.5 m, a width of 1.2 m, and a height of 1.8 m. Calculate its volume in liters.
3. A sphere has a radius of 0.75 m. Calculate its volume in cubic meters.
4. A cylindrical container has a radius of 10 cm and a height of 25 cm. Calculate its volume in cubic centimeters.

Answers:
1. 125 cm³
2. 5,400 L
3. Approximately 1.77 m³
4. 7,853.98 cm³
