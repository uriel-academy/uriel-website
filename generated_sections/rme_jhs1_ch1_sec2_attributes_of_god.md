## Introduction
Kofi and Ama, two JHS 1 students from Accra, were walking home from school one day discussing their RME lesson about the attributes of God. They realized that despite the different religious backgrounds in their class, with some students being Christian, others Muslim, and some following Traditional African Religion, they all believed in a Supreme Being with similar attributes. This sparked their curiosity to learn more about how these attributes shape the lives of Ghanaians across the country, from the bustling streets of Kumasi to the serene villages in the countryside.

As they continued their journey, they noticed the harmony among people of different faiths, with churches and mosques standing side by side and traditional religious practices being respected. They began to understand that recognizing and appreciating the attributes of God, as understood by various religions, could foster a more peaceful and morally upright society in Ghana.

## Main Content
### Omnipotence: God's Unlimited Power
In Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African Religion, God is believed to be **omnipotent**, meaning that He has unlimited power and can do anything that is consistent with His nature. This attribute is evident in the creation of the universe and the miracles described in religious texts. For example, in Christianity, Jesus Christ performed miracles such as healing the sick and raising the dead, demonstrating God's power over nature and life itself.

### Omniscience: God's All-Knowing Nature
Another essential attribute of God is His **omniscience**, which means that He has complete knowledge of everything – past, present, and future. In Islam, Allah is described as the "All-Knowing," and Muslims believe that nothing happens without His knowledge and permission. This attribute encourages Ghanaians to be mindful of their actions, as God is aware of everything they do.

### Omnipresence: God's Presence Everywhere
God is also believed to be **omnipresent**, meaning that He is present everywhere at all times. In Traditional African Religion, the Supreme Being is thought to be present in all aspects of life, from the natural world to human affairs. This attribute promotes a sense of reverence and respect for God among Ghanaians, as they recognize His presence in their daily lives.

### Love and Mercy: God's Compassion for Humanity
Across all three religions, God is characterized by His love and mercy towards humanity. Christians believe that God demonstrated His ultimate love by sending His son, Jesus Christ, to die for the sins of mankind. In Islam, Allah is referred to as the "Most Merciful" and "Most Compassionate," emphasizing His forgiving nature. Traditional African Religion also recognizes the benevolence of the Supreme Being towards His creation.
