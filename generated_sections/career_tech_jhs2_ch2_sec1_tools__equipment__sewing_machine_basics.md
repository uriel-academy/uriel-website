## Introduction
Sewing is an essential skill that plays a vital role in the daily lives of Ghanaians.

Many Ghanaians, especially women, earn a living as tailors, seamstresses, and fashion designers. They create beautiful garments for their clients, ranging from everyday wear to special occasion attire.

## Main Content
### Parts of a Sewing Machine

A sewing machine consists of several important parts, each with a specific function:
- **Bobbin**: Holds the lower thread
- **Bobbin case**: Houses the bobbin and controls the tension of the lower thread
- **Needle**: Carries the upper thread and pierces the fabric
- **Presser foot**: Holds the fabric in place while sewing
- **Feed dogs**: Move the fabric through the machine as you sew
- **Handwheel**: Allows manual control of the needle
- **Thread guides**: Direct the upper thread from the spool to the needle

### Threading the Machine
Properly threading your sewing machine is crucial for achieving good results. Follow these steps:

1. Place the spool of thread on the spool pin
2. Guide the thread through the thread guides
3. Wind the thread around the tension disc
4. Thread the needle from front to back
5. Draw up the bobbin thread by turning the handwheel

### Sewing Straight and Curved Lines
To sew straight lines:
1. Position the fabric under the presser foot, aligning the edge with the seam guide
2. Lower the needle into the fabric
3. Gently press the foot pedal to start sewing
4. Guide the fabric through the machine, keeping it aligned with the seam guide

To sew curved lines:
1. Position the fabric under the presser foot
2. Lower the needle into the fabric
3. Sew slowly, gently guiding the fabric in the desired direction
4. Pivot the fabric with the needle down to change direction smoothly

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Thread bunching or breaking | Rethread the machine, checking tension and thread guides |
| Skipped stitches | Replace the needle, check threading and bobbin |
| Fabric not feeding properly | Ensure feed dogs are engaged, check presser foot pressure |

### Safety Precautions
- Always unplug the machine when threading or changing the needle
- Keep fingers away from moving parts, especially the needle
- Wear closed-toe shoes to protect your feet from fallen needles or pins
- Tie back long hair and avoid loose clothing that could get caught in the machine

## Practical Activity
1. Create a drawstring bag using local fabric (e.g., kente or batik)
   - Materials: 1/2 yard of fabric, matching thread, scissors, measuring tape, pins
   - Instructions:
     1. Cut two rectangles of fabric, each measuring 15 inches by 20 inches
     2. Pin the rectangles together with the right sides facing each other
     3. Sew along three sides, leaving the top open
     4. Fold the top edge down 1/2 inch and press, then fold again 1 1/2 inches and press
     5. Sew along the folded edge, leaving a small opening for the drawstring
     6. Thread a ribbon or cord through the opening to create the drawstring
   - Expected outcome: A functional drawstring bag with neat, even stitches

2. Create a simple apron for cooking or selling food
   - Materials: 1 yard of fabric, matching thread, scissors, measuring tape, pins
   - Instructions:
     1. Cut a rectangle of fabric, measuring 24 inches by 36 inches
     2. Fold the top edge down 1/2 inch and press, then fold again 1 1/2 inches and press
     3. Sew along the folded edge to create a casing for the neck strap
     4. Cut two strips of fabric, each measuring 4 inches by 20 inches, for the waist ties
     5. Attach the waist ties to the sides of the apron, folding the edges under and sewing securely
   - Expected outcome: A functional apron with neat, even stitches and securely attached ties
