## Introduction
In Ghana, understanding the area of triangles is essential for various aspects of daily life. For example, when shopping at the market, you may need to calculate the area of a triangular piece of cloth to determine the fair price. In agriculture, farmers often need to measure the area of triangular plots of land to plan their crops effectively. Additionally, architects and engineers use their knowledge of triangular areas to design structures like roofs and bridges. As you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering the concepts related to the area of triangles will help you solve practical problems and excel in your mathematics assessment.

## Main Content
### Formula for the Area of a Triangle
The basic formula for the area of a triangle is:

$A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$

where:
- $A$ is the area of the triangle
- $b$ is the base of the triangle
- $h$ is the height (or altitude) of the triangle perpendicular to the base

### Using Trigonometric Ratios to Find the Area
When the height of a triangle is not given, we can use trigonometric ratios (sine and cosine) to find the area. The formulas are:

$A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \times \sin(C)$
$A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c \times \sin(A)$
$A = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times a \times \sin(B)$

where:
- $A$, $B$, and $C$ are the angles of the triangle
- $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides opposite to angles $A$, $B$, and $C$, respectively

### Heron's Formula
Heron's formula allows us to find the area of a triangle when we know the lengths of all three sides. The formula is:

$A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$

where:
- $s$ is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as $s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$
- $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the lengths of the sides of the triangle

### Properties of Triangles
To find the area of a triangle, it is important to understand the relationship between its base, height, and angles. Some key properties include:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Base and Height | The base and height must be perpendicular to each other. |
| Angles | The sum of the three angles in a triangle is always 180°. |
| Side Lengths | The length of any side must be less than the sum of the other two sides. |

## Worked Examples
### Example 1
A farmer in the Volta Region has a triangular plot of land. The base of the plot is 40 meters, and the height is 30 meters. Find the area of the plot.

Solution:
Given:
- Base ($b$) = 40 m
- Height ($h$) = 30 m

Using the formula for the area of a triangle:
$A = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h$
$A = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 \times 30$
$A = 600$ m²

Therefore, the area of the triangular plot is 600 square meters.

### Example 2
An architect is designing a triangular roof for a new building. The roof has a base of 12 meters and makes an angle of 35° with one of the other sides. If this side has a length of 10 meters, find the area of the roof.

[IMAGE: A labeled triangle with base 12 m, angle 35°, and side 10 m.]

Solution:
Given:
- Base ($b$) = 12 m
- Angle ($C$) = 35°
- Side ($a$) = 10 m

Using the trigonometric formula for the area of a triangle:
$A = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times b \times \sin(C)$
$A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 12 \times \sin(35°)$
$A = 60 \times \sin(35°)$
$A = 60 \times 0.5736$
$A = 34.42$ m²

Therefore, the area of the triangular roof is approximately 34.42 square meters.

### Example 3
A seamstress at Makola Market has a triangular piece of kente cloth with side lengths of 6 meters, 8 meters, and 10 meters. Calculate the area of the cloth.

Solution:
Given:
- Side lengths: $a$ = 6 m, $b$ = 8 m, $c$ = 10 m

First, calculate the semi-perimeter ($s$):
$s = \frac{a+b+c}{2}$
$s = \frac{6+8+10}{2}$
$s = \frac{24}{2}$
$s = 12$ m

Using Heron's formula:
$A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$
$A = \sqrt{12(12-6)(12-8)(12-10)}$
$A = \sqrt{12 \times 6 \times 4 \times 2}$
$A = \sqrt{576}$
$A = 24$ m²

Therefore, the area of the triangular kente cloth is 24 square meters.

2. A triangular sail on a fishing boat has a base of 6 meters and makes an angle of 40° with one of the other sides. If this side has a length of 5 meters, find the area of the sail.
3. A triangular flag has side lengths of 3 meters, 4 meters, and 5 meters. Calculate the area of the flag.

1. 90 m²
2. 11.5 m²
3. 6 m²
