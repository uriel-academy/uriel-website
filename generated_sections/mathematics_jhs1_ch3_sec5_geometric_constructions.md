## Introduction
Geometric constructions are an essential part of mathematics that have many real-life applications. In Ghana, these skills can be used in various situations, such as designing layouts for farms, creating patterns for clothing, or planning the construction of buildings. For example, a farmer in the Volta Region may need to divide their land into equal parts for different crops, which can be done using angle bisection. A seamstress in Kumasi might use parallel lines to create a consistent pattern on a piece of fabric for a new dress. Preparing for the BECE exams also requires a strong understanding of geometric constructions, as these topics are frequently tested. By mastering the skills in this section, students will be well-equipped to tackle problems both in their daily lives and in their academic pursuits.

## Main Content
### Constructing Angles (90°, 60°, 45°, and 30°)
To construct specific angles using a pair of compasses and a ruler, follow these steps:
1. Draw a straight line and mark a point on it. This will be the vertex of the angle.
2. Place the compass point on the vertex and draw an arc that intersects the line at two points.
3. Place the compass point on one of the intersections and draw an arc above or below the line.
4. Without changing the compass width, place the point on the other intersection and draw another arc that crosses the first arc.
5. Draw a line from the vertex through the point where the two arcs cross. This line forms the desired angle with the original line.

To construct a 90° angle, follow the same steps but ensure that the two arcs drawn in step 3 and 4 are of equal radius and that they intersect at a point equidistant from the vertex.

For a 45° angle, first construct a 90° angle and then bisect it using the angle bisection method described below.

To construct a 30° angle, first construct a 60° angle and then bisect it.

### Bisecting an Angle
To bisect an angle using a pair of compasses and a ruler:
1. Place the compass point on the vertex of the angle and draw an arc that intersects both sides of the angle.
2. Without changing the compass width, place the point on one of the intersections and draw an arc inside the angle.
3. Repeat step 2 with the other intersection.
4. Draw a line from the vertex through the point where the two arcs cross. This line bisects the angle.

### Constructing Parallel Lines
To construct a line parallel to a given line through a point:
1. Draw a line and mark a point above or below the line.
2. Place the compass point on the given point and draw an arc that intersects the line at two points.
3. Without changing the compass width, place the point on one of the intersections and draw an arc above or below the line.
4. Place the compass point on the other intersection and draw another arc that crosses the first arc.
5. Draw a line through the given point and the point where the two arcs cross. This line is parallel to the original line.

### Constructing Triangles
To construct an equilateral triangle:
1. Draw a line segment of the desired length.
2. Place the compass point on one end of the segment and draw an arc with radius equal to the segment length.
3. Repeat step 2 with the other end of the segment.
4. Draw lines connecting the ends of the original segment to the point where the two arcs cross. This forms an equilateral triangle.

To construct an isosceles triangle:
1. Draw a line segment of the desired length for the base.
2. Place the compass point on one end of the segment and draw an arc with the desired radius for the equal sides.
3. Repeat step 2 with the other end of the segment.
4. Draw lines connecting the ends of the base to the point where the two arcs cross. This forms an isosceles triangle.

To construct a right-angled triangle:
1. Draw a line segment for the base of the triangle.
2. Construct a 90° angle at one end of the segment using the method described earlier.
3. Mark the desired length for the height of the triangle on the line forming the 90° angle.
4. Draw a line connecting the mark on the height to the other end of the base. This forms a right-angled triangle.

## Worked Examples
1. Kofi wants to divide his rectangular farm into four equal parts so that he can grow different crops. If the farm measures 120 meters by 90 meters, how can he use geometric constructions to divide the land?

Solution:
- First, construct a perpendicular bisector of the 120-meter side:
  a. Place the compass point on one end of the 120-meter side and draw an arc above and below the side.
  b. Repeat step a with the other end of the side.
  c. Draw a line connecting the points where the arcs intersect. This line bisects the 120-meter side and is perpendicular to it.
- Repeat the process to construct a perpendicular bisector of the 90-meter side.
- The two perpendicular bisectors divide the farm into four equal parts, each measuring 60 meters by 45 meters.

2. Adwoa is designing a new dress pattern and wants to create a series of parallel lines 5 cm apart. If she starts with a line segment measuring 30 cm, how can she construct the parallel lines using a pair of compasses and a ruler?

Solution:
- Draw a line segment measuring 30 cm.
- Mark points at 5 cm intervals along the line segment.
- Use the method for constructing parallel lines through a point:
  a. Place the compass point on the first marked point and draw an arc intersecting the line segment.
  b. Without changing the compass width, place the point on one of the intersections and draw an arc above the line segment.
  c. Place the compass point on the other intersection and draw another arc crossing the first arc.
  d. Draw a line through the marked point and the point where the arcs cross. This line is parallel to the original line segment.
- Repeat the process for each marked point to create a series of parallel lines 5 cm apart.

3. Kwame is preparing for his BECE exams and needs to practice constructing a 60° angle. Using a pair of compasses and a ruler, how can he construct this angle?

Solution:
- Draw a line segment and mark a point on it. This will be the vertex of the angle.
- Place the compass point on the vertex and draw an arc intersecting the line segment at two points.
- Without changing the compass width, place the point on one of the intersections and draw an arc above the line segment.
- Place the compass point on the other intersection and draw another arc crossing the first arc.
- Draw a line from the vertex through the point where the arcs cross. This line forms a 60° angle with the original line segment.
