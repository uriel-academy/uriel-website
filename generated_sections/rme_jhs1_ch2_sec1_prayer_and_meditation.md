## Introduction
Kofi, Ama, and their classmates live in the vibrant city of Accra, where the sounds of Islamic calls to prayer from mosques blend with the joyful hymns rising from churches. As they walk to school, they pass by a traditional shrine where people leave offerings and say prayers to their ancestors. Ghana is a country rich in religious diversity, with Christians, Muslims, and followers of Traditional African Religion living together peacefully. In this lesson, we will explore the importance of prayer and meditation across these different faith traditions and how these practices can help students like Kofi and Ama develop strong moral character.

## Main Content
### Forms of Prayer and Meditation
Prayer and meditation take different forms across Ghana's religious communities:
- **Christians** often pray using the Lord's Prayer, reciting Bible verses, or offering spontaneous prayers. Some also practice contemplative prayer or meditate on scripture passages.
- **Muslims** pray five times a day facing Mecca. They recite verses from the Quran and supplications. Sufi Muslims also practice dhikr, the remembrance of Allah through repeated phrases.
- In **Traditional African Religion**, prayers are offered to the Supreme Being, lesser gods, ancestors, and spirits. Meditation often involves communing with nature or sacred objects.
