## Learning Objectives

3. Evaluate powers and roots of real numbers
4. Solve problems involving powers and roots in real-life situations

## Introduction
In our everyday lives, we often encounter situations that involve repeated multiplication or division. For example, when you visit the market in Accra to buy groceries, you might need to calculate the cost of buying multiple items of the same price. If you're saving money in your mobile money account, you might want to know how much you'll have after a certain period of consistent saving. Powers and roots help us simplify these calculations and solve problems more efficiently.

Moreover, understanding powers and roots is crucial for your success in the BECE mathematics exam. Mastering these concepts will not only help you solve complex problems quickly but also lay a strong foundation for your future studies in mathematics and science.

## Main Content
### Powers and Exponents
A power is a way of expressing repeated multiplication of a number by itself. The number being multiplied is called the **base**, and the number of times it is multiplied is called the **exponent** or **index**. For example, $2^3$ means $2 \times 2 \times 2$, which equals $8$.

The general form of a power is:
$a^n = \underbrace{a \times a \times \cdots \times a}_\text{n times}$

where $a$ is the base and $n$ is the exponent.

### Laws of Indices
The laws of indices help us simplify expressions involving powers. Here are the main laws:

| Law | Formula |
|-----|---------|
| Product Rule | $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$ |
| Quotient Rule | $\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$ |
| Power Rule | $(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}$ |
| Zero Exponent Rule | $a^0 = 1$ (for $a \neq 0$) |
| Negative Exponent Rule | $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$ |

### Roots and Radicals
A root is the inverse operation of a power. It helps us find the base when the exponent and the result are known. The most common roots are:

- Square root ($\sqrt{a}$): The number which, when multiplied by itself, gives $a$. For example, $\sqrt{16} = 4$ because $4 \times 4 = 16$.
- Cube root ($\sqrt[3]{a}$): The number which, when multiplied by itself three times, gives $a$. For example, $\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ because $2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$.

The general form of a root is:
$\sqrt[n]{a} = b$ if and only if $b^n = a$

### Properties of Roots
Here are some important properties of roots:

| Property | Formula |
|----------|---------|
| Product Property | $\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{ab}$ |
| Quotient Property | $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}} = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b}}$ |
| Power Property | $\sqrt{a^n} = (\sqrt{a})^n$ |

## Worked Examples
1. Simplify the expression: $3^2 \times 3^4$

   Using the product rule: $3^2 \times 3^4 = 3^{2+4} = 3^6 = 729$

2. Evaluate: $\sqrt{144} - \sqrt[3]{64}$

   $\sqrt{144} = 12$ and $\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$

   Therefore, $\sqrt{144} - \sqrt[3]{64} = 12 - 4 = 8$

3. Kofi is saving money in his mobile money account. If he saves GH₵50 per week, how much money will he have after 12 weeks?

   We can use powers to solve this problem:
   
   Amount saved = GH₵50 $\times$ $12$ weeks = GH₵50 $\times$ $2^2 \times 3$ = GH₵50 $\times$ $4 \times 3$ = GH₵600

   Therefore, Kofi will have GH₵600 in his mobile money account after 12 weeks.

## Practice Problems
1. Simplify: $(2^3)^4$
2. Evaluate: $\sqrt{81} + \sqrt[3]{27}$
3. Ama bought 5 bags of rice, each weighing 2 kg. If each bag costs GH₵30, how much did she spend in total?

Answers:
1. $4096$
2. $12$
3. GH₵150

## Summary
- Powers are a way of expressing repeated multiplication, while roots are the inverse operation of powers.
- The laws of indices help simplify expressions involving powers.
- Roots, such as square roots and cube roots, help find the base when the exponent and the result are known.
