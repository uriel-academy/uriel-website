## Introduction
Have you ever wondered what happens to the delicious jollof rice or fufu you eat? How does your body break down food and use it for energy and growth? The digestive system is responsible for processing the food we eat and extracting the nutrients our bodies need. In Ghana, we are fortunate to have a variety of nutritious foods, such as yams, plantains, and cocoa beans. Understanding how our digestive system works can help us make healthier food choices and prevent digestive problems.

As Ghanaian students, learning about the digestive system is essential for maintaining good health. By studying the organs and processes involved in digestion, we can appreciate the importance of a balanced diet and proper hygiene. In this lesson, we will explore the fascinating world of the digestive system and discover how it helps us grow and thrive.

## Main Content
### Organs of the Digestive System
The digestive system consists of several organs that work together to process food:
1. **Mouth**: The mouth is where digestion begins. Teeth mechanically break down food, while saliva contains enzymes that start to chemically digest carbohydrates.
2. **Esophagus**: The esophagus is a muscular tube that transports food from the mouth to the stomach.
3. **Stomach**: The stomach is a muscular sac that churns food and secretes acid and enzymes to further break down food.
4. **Small intestine**: The small intestine is where most digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. It is divided into three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
5. **Large intestine**: The large intestine, or colon, absorbs water and forms feces from undigested food.
6. **Rectum and anus**: The rectum stores feces before elimination through the anus.

### Processes of Digestion
Digestion involves four main processes:
1. **Ingestion**: Taking food into the mouth
2. **Digestion**: Breaking down food into smaller molecules through mechanical and chemical means
3. **Absorption**: Transporting nutrients from the digestive tract into the bloodstream
4. **Egestion**: Eliminating undigested food as feces

### Role of Enzymes
Enzymes are biological catalysts that speed up chemical reactions in the body. In digestion, enzymes break down large food molecules into smaller ones that can be absorbed. The main digestive enzymes are:
- **Amylase**: Breaks down carbohydrates (found in saliva and pancreatic juice)
- **Pepsin**: Breaks down proteins (found in stomach)
- **Lipase**: Breaks down fats (found in pancreatic juice)
- **Trypsin**: Breaks down proteins (found in pancreatic juice)

### Practical Experiment: Enzyme Action on Starch
Materials:
- Cooked cassava or yam
- Iodine solution
- Saliva
- Test tubes or clear containers

Procedure:
1. Mash a small piece of cooked cassava or yam in a test tube.
2. Add a few drops of iodine solution to the mashed food. The presence of starch will turn the iodine blue-black.
3. In another test tube, collect some saliva (make sure not to contaminate it with food particles).
4. Add the saliva to the mashed food and mix well.
5. After a few minutes, add a few drops of iodine solution to the mixture.
6. Observe the color change. If the iodine remains brown, it indicates that the amylase in saliva has broken down the starch.

This experiment demonstrates the action of the enzyme amylase in saliva on the starch present in cassava or yam.

## Worked Example
Calculating the Energy Content of Food

If a serving of fufu (300g) contains 120 calories, calculate the energy content in kilojoules (kJ).

Given:
- Mass of fufu = 300g
- Energy content in calories = 120 cal

Step 1: Convert calories to kilojoules
1 calorie = 4.184 joules
120 cal × 4.184 J/cal = 502.08 J

Step 2: Convert joules to kilojoules
1 kilojoule = 1000 joules
502.08 J ÷ 1000 J/kJ = 0.50208 kJ

Therefore, a 300g serving of fufu contains approximately 0.50 kJ of energy.

## Summary
- The main organs of the digestive system are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.
- Digestion involves ingestion, digestion, absorption, and egestion.
- Enzymes are biological catalysts that break down food molecules during digestion.
- The main digestive enzymes are amylase, pepsin, lipase, and trypsin.
- A balanced diet is essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system.
- Practical experiments can demonstrate the action of digestive enzymes.
