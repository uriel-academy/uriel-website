## Introduction
Kofi and Ama, two JHS 2 students from Accra, have been best friends since childhood. Despite coming from different religious backgrounds, with Kofi being a Christian and Ama being a Muslim, they have always respected and supported each other's beliefs. One day, while walking home from school, Ama invites Kofi to join her family for a special Iftar dinner during the month of Ramadan. Kofi eagerly accepts the invitation, excited to learn more about Ama's faith and the teachings of the Quran.

In Ghana, a country known for its religious diversity, it is essential for students like Kofi and Ama to understand and appreciate the different religious scriptures that guide the lives of their fellow Ghanaians. The Quran, the holy book of Islam, plays a significant role in shaping the beliefs, values, and practices of Muslims across the country, from the bustling streets of Accra to the historic mosques of Kumasi.

## Main Content
### The Revelation of the Quran
The Quran is believed by Muslims to be the direct word of Allah (God), revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the Angel Jibril (Gabriel) over a period of 23 years. The revelation began in the year 610 CE, when Muhammad was 40 years old, and continued until his death in 632 CE.

### Structure and Content of the Quran
The Quran consists of 114 chapters, known as **surahs**, and 6,236 verses, called **ayahs**. The surahs vary in length, with the shortest having just three verses and the longest containing 286 verses. The Quran covers a wide range of topics, including:
- Belief in one God (Allah) and His prophets
- Moral and ethical guidelines for living a righteous life
- Stories of past prophets and nations
- The nature of the afterlife and the Day of Judgment

### The Quran in the Lives of Ghanaian Muslims
For Muslims in Ghana, the Quran is not just a religious scripture but a way of life. It guides their daily practices, moral decisions, and interactions with others. Many Ghanaian Muslims:

- Attend Quranic schools (Makaranta) to deepen their understanding of the holy book
- Seek guidance from the Quran when facing challenges or making important decisions
- Strive to embody the moral lessons and values taught in the Quran in their daily lives

## Examples

2. During the month of Ramadan, Abena, a Christian student, notices her Muslim classmates fasting from dawn to sunset. Curious about their practice, she learns that fasting is prescribed in the Quran as a means of developing self-discipline, empathy, and spiritual growth.
