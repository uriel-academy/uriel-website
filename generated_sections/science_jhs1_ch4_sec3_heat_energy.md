## Section: Heat Energy

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Define heat energy and explain its sources
2. Describe the three methods of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation
3. Understand the concept of thermal expansion and its applications
4. Identify ways to conserve heat energy in everyday life

## Introduction
Heat energy plays a vital role in our daily lives, from cooking our meals to powering industries. In Ghana, we experience heat energy in various forms, such as the warmth from the sun in our tropical climate, the heat generated from burning firewood to process cocoa beans, and the steam produced in the turbines of the Akosombo Hydroelectric Dam to generate electricity. Understanding heat energy and its properties is essential for students to appreciate its significance and learn how to use it efficiently.

## Main Content
### Sources of Heat Energy
Heat energy can be generated from various sources, including:
1. The sun: Solar energy is the primary source of heat for the Earth.
2. Combustion: Burning of fuels such as wood, charcoal, and natural gas releases heat energy.
3. Electrical energy: Electric currents flowing through conductors produce heat due to resistance.
4. Geothermal energy: Heat from the Earth's interior can be harnessed for heating and power generation.

### Methods of Heat Transfer
Heat energy can be transferred from one object to another through three main methods:
1. **Conduction**: Heat transfer through direct contact between objects. Example: Heat from a pot conducts to the food inside it.
2. **Convection**: Heat transfer through the movement of fluids or gases. Example: Hot air rising from a bonfire.
3. **Radiation**: Heat transfer through electromagnetic waves without the need for a medium. Example: Heat from the sun reaching the Earth.

### Thermal Expansion
Thermal expansion is the increase in the size of an object as its temperature rises. Most substances expand when heated and contract when cooled. This property has various applications, such as:
- Thermometers: The expansion of liquid (mercury or alcohol) in a thermometer indicates the temperature.
- Bridges: Expansion joints allow bridges to expand and contract without damage due to temperature changes.
- Cooking: Food expands when heated, which is why cake batter rises in the oven.

### Conserving Heat Energy
Conserving heat energy is essential for saving resources and reducing environmental impact. Some ways to conserve heat energy include:
- Using energy-efficient appliances and light bulbs
- Insulating buildings to minimize heat loss
- Using solar cookers or hay baskets for cooking
- Wearing appropriate clothing to maintain body heat

**Practical Example: Solar Cooker**
Students can make a simple solar cooker using locally available materials:
1. Get a cardboard box, aluminum foil, black paper, and clear plastic wrap.
2. Line the inside of the box with aluminum foil, glued shiny side out.
3. Place a sheet of black paper at the bottom of the box.
4. Cover the top of the box with clear plastic wrap, sealing it tightly.
5. Place the food to be cooked in a dark-colored pot inside the box.
6. Place the solar cooker in direct sunlight, adjusting its angle to maximize heat absorption.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the amount of heat energy required to raise the temperature of 2 kg of water from 25°C to 75°C. (Specific heat capacity of water = 4,200 J/kg·°C)

Solution:
Heat energy (Q) = mass (m) × specific heat capacity (c) × temperature change (ΔT)
Q = 2 kg × 4,200 J/kg·°C × (75°C - 25°C)
Q = 2 kg × 4,200 J/kg·°C × 50°C
Q = 420,000 J = 420 kJ

2. A brass rod has a length of 1 m at 20°C. If the linear expansion coefficient of brass is 18.7 × 10⁻⁶ /°C, calculate its new length when heated to 100°C.

Solution:
Linear expansion = initial length (L₀) × linear expansion coefficient (α) × temperature change (ΔT)
ΔL = 1 m × 18.7 × 10⁻⁶ /°C × (100°C - 20°C)
ΔL = 1 m × 18.7 × 10⁻⁶ /°C × 80°C
ΔL = 0.001496 m
New length = initial length + linear expansion
New length = 1 m + 0.001496 m = 1.001496 m
