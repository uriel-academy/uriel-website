## Section: Distance Between Points

## Learning Objectives
After studying this section, students will be able to:
1. Understand and apply the Cartesian coordinate system

3. Calculate the distance between two points using the distance formula
4. Solve real-world problems involving distance in a coordinate plane

## Introduction
In our daily lives, we often need to find the distance between two locations. For example, when you visit the market in Accra, you might want to know the distance between your home and the market to estimate the transportation cost. Or, if you are helping on a farm, you may need to calculate the distance between two points in a field to determine the length of a fence or the area of a plot. Understanding coordinate geometry and the distance formula will help you solve these problems easily.

Coordinate geometry is also an essential topic for the BECE examination. By mastering the concepts in this section, you will be well-prepared to tackle distance-related questions on the exam and achieve excellent results.

## Main Content
### The Cartesian Coordinate System
The Cartesian coordinate system, named after the mathematician René Descartes, is a way to describe the position of points on a flat surface called a **coordinate plane**. The coordinate plane consists of two perpendicular lines called the **x-axis** (horizontal) and the **y-axis** (vertical), which intersect at a point called the **origin**. The origin has the coordinates (0, 0).

### Coordinates of Points
Any point on the coordinate plane can be described by an ordered pair of numbers **(x, y)**, where **x** represents the distance from the origin along the x-axis, and **y** represents the distance from the origin along the y-axis. The x-value is called the **abscissa**, and the y-value is called the **ordinate**.

To find the coordinates of a point:
1. Start at the origin (0, 0)
2. Move horizontally along the x-axis (right for positive values, left for negative values)
3. Move vertically along the y-axis (up for positive values, down for negative values)

### The Distance Formula
The distance between two points on a coordinate plane can be calculated using the **distance formula**. For two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the distance $d$ between them is given by:

$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

This formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

### Properties of the Distance Formula
The distance formula has the following properties:
1. Distance is always positive or zero
2. Distance is symmetric, meaning the distance from point A to point B is the same as the distance from point B to point A
3. The distance between a point and itself is zero

| Property | Mathematical Expression |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Non-negativity | $d \geq 0$ |
| Symmetry | $d(A, B) = d(B, A)$ |
| Zero distance | $d(A, A) = 0$ |

## Worked Examples
### Example 1
Find the distance between the points A(2, 3) and B(5, 7).

Solution:
Let's use the distance formula with $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 3)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (5, 7)$.

$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (7 - 3)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}$
$d = \sqrt{9 + 16}$
$d = \sqrt{25}$
$d = 5$

Therefore, the distance between points A and B is 5 units.

### Example 2
Kofi wants to calculate the distance between his house at (3, 4) and his friend Ama's house at (-2, 1) on a coordinate plane where each unit represents 100 meters. How far apart are their houses?

Solution:
Let's use the distance formula with $(x_1, y_1) = (3, 4)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (-2, 1)$.

$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{(-2 - 3)^2 + (1 - 4)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{(-5)^2 + (-3)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{25 + 9}$
$d = \sqrt{34}$
$d \approx 5.83$

Since each unit represents 100 meters, the actual distance is:
$5.83 \times 100 = 583$ meters

Therefore, Kofi's house and Ama's house are approximately 583 meters apart.

### Example 3
A farmer in Kumasi has a rectangular plot of land with corners at (0, 0), (0, 6), (8, 6), and (8, 0). Find the length and width of the plot.

[IMAGE: A rectangular plot on a coordinate plane with the corners labeled]

Solution:
To find the length and width, we need to calculate the distances between the appropriate pairs of corners.

Length (distance between (0, 0) and (8, 0)):
$d = \sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 0} = \sqrt{64} = 8$

Width (distance between (0, 0) and (0, 6)):
$d = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 36} = \sqrt{36} = 6$

Therefore, the length of the plot is 8 units, and the width is 6 units.

## Practice Problems
1. Find the distance between the points (3, -2) and (-1, 4).
2. Abena is planning to install a fence between two points in her garden, located at (2, 5) and (7, 1). Each unit on the coordinate plane represents 50 cm. How long will the fence be?
3. A square has vertices at (0, 0), (0, 5), (5, 5), and (5, 0). Find the length of one side of the square.

(Answers: 1. $\sqrt{52}$; 2. 559.02 cm; 3. 5 units)
