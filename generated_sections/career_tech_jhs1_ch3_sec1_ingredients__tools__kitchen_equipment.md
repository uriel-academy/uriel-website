### Knife Safety and Handling
Knives are one of the most important tools in the kitchen, but they can also be dangerous if not used properly. Follow these safety rules when handling knives:

1. Always keep knives sharp - a dull knife is more likely to slip and cause injuries
2. Hold the knife firmly by the handle with your dominant hand
3. Use your other hand to hold the food steady on the cutting board - curl your fingertips under to avoid cuts
4. Cut away from your body, never towards yourself
5. Clean and store knives properly after use - avoid leaving them in the sink or drawer where someone could get cut

### Cooking Equipment for Ghanaian Dishes
Different Ghanaian dishes require specific equipment to prepare. Here are some examples:

| Fufu | Mortar and pestle, cooking pot |
| Banku | Cooking pot, wooden stirrer, bowls |

When selecting equipment for a recipe, consider the cooking method (boiling, frying, steaming) and the quantity of food being prepared.

### Cleaning and Maintenance 
Proper cleaning and maintenance of kitchen equipment is important for food safety and extending the life of your tools. Some key tips:

- Wash cutting boards, knives, and utensils with hot, soapy water after each use
- Dry equipment thoroughly before storing to prevent rust and bacterial growth
- Sharpen knives regularly to maintain their effectiveness 
- Replace worn or damaged equipment as needed

## Practical Activity
### Make Your Own Jollof Spice Blend
In this activity, you will use kitchen equipment to create a flavorful spice blend for making jollof rice. 

Materials needed:
- Mortar and pestle or spice grinder

Instructions:
1. Measure out 1 tablespoon each of cumin seeds, anise seeds, ground ginger, and black peppercorns. Add 1 teaspoon each of cloves and nutmeg.
2. Place the spices into the mortar or grinder. If using a mortar and pestle, grind the spices together using a circular motion until they form a fine powder. If using a spice grinder, pulse the spices until finely ground.
3. Transfer the blended spices to a small bowl or airtight container. Label with the name and date.

Your jollof spice blend is ready to use! Store it in a cool, dry place. The blend can be added to your jollof rice recipe to give the dish a delicious, aromatic flavor.
