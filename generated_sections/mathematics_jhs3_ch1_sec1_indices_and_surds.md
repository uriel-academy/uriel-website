## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Simplify expressions involving indices and surds
2. Apply the laws of indices to solve problems
3. Rationalize the denominator of surd expressions
4. Solve BECE-style questions involving indices and surds

## Introduction
Indices and surds are essential mathematical concepts that have numerous applications in everyday life. For example, when you visit the market in Ghana, you might need to calculate the cost of items sold in large quantities. If a bag of rice costs GH₵25 and you want to buy 10³ bags for a community event, you can use your knowledge of indices to determine the total cost: 25 × 10³ = 25 × 1,000 = GH₵25,000.

Similarly, surds are used in various fields, such as construction and engineering. If you're helping your family build a new farm storage unit and need to calculate the diagonal length of the floor, you can use the Pythagorean theorem and surds. For a rectangular floor with a length of 4 meters and a width of 3 meters, the diagonal length is √(4² + 3²) = √25 = 5 meters.

As you prepare for your BECE exams, mastering indices and surds will help you solve complex problems quickly and accurately, giving you an advantage in the exam hall and beyond.

## Main Content
### Laws of Indices
The laws of indices are a set of rules that simplify expressions involving powers. The main laws are:

1. Multiplication law: $a^m × a^n = a^{m+n}$
2. Division law: $\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$
3. Power law: $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$
4. Zero exponent law: $a^0 = 1$ (for $a ≠ 0$)
5. Negative exponent law: $a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$

### Simplifying Surd Expressions
A surd is an expression containing a square root (√) that cannot be simplified further. To simplify surd expressions, follow these steps:

1. Simplify any perfect square factors under the square root.
2. Combine like surds by adding or subtracting their coefficients.
3. Rationalize the denominator if the surd is in the denominator.

### Rationalizing the Denominator
To rationalize the denominator of a surd expression, multiply both the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of $a + b√c$ is $a - b√c$, and vice versa.

For example, to rationalize $\frac{1}{2+√3}$:
$\frac{1}{2+√3} × \frac{2-√3}{2-√3} = \frac{2-√3}{4-3} = \frac{2-√3}{1} = 2-√3$

### Properties of Surds
| Property | Example |
|----------|---------|
| $√a × √b = √(ab)$ | $√2 × √3 = √6$ |
| $\frac{√a}{√b} = √(\frac{a}{b})$ | $\frac{√8}{√2} = √4 = 2$ |
| $(√a)^n = √(a^n)$ | $(√2)^3 = √(2^3) = √8$ |

## Worked Examples
1. Simplify $(2^3)^4 ÷ 2^5$.
   
   Using the power law and division law:
   $(2^3)^4 ÷ 2^5 = 2^{3×4} ÷ 2^5 = 2^{12} ÷ 2^5 = 2^{12-5} = 2^7 = 128$

2. Simplify $3√2 + 2√8 - √18$.
   
   Simplify surds under the square root:
   $3√2 + 2√(4×2) - √(9×2)$
   $= 3√2 + 2×2√2 - 3√2$
   $= 3√2 + 4√2 - 3√2$
   $= 4√2$

3. A rectangular plot of land in a village has a length of 12 meters and a width of 5 meters. Calculate the diagonal length of the plot.

   [IMAGE: A rectangle with length 12 m and width 5 m, and a diagonal line connecting opposite corners]

   Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   $diagonal^2 = 12^2 + 5^2$
   $diagonal^2 = 144 + 25 = 169$
   $diagonal = √169 = 13$ meters

4. Kwame is building a square water tank with a volume of 216 cubic meters. Calculate the length of each side of the tank.

   Let the length of each side be $x$ meters.
   $Volume = x^3$
   $216 = x^3$
   $x = ∛216$
   $x = 6$ meters

## Practice Problems
1. Simplify $\frac{6^2 × 6^4}{6^3}$.
2. Simplify $2√3 + 5√12 - √27$.
3. Rationalize the denominator of $\frac{4}{√5}$.
4. A square floor tile has an area of 18 square centimeters. Calculate the length of each side of the tile.

(Answers: 1. 6³ = 216, 2. 7√3, 3. $\frac{4√5}{5}$, 4. 3√2 cm)
