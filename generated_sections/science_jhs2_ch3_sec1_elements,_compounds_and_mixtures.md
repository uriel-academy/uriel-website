## Introduction
In our daily lives in Ghana, we encounter countless substances - from the air we breathe, to the water we drink from boreholes, to the chocolate made from our cocoa beans. But have you ever wondered what these substances are made of at the most basic level? The answer lies in understanding the chemistry of matter. 

Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms. The way these atoms are arranged determines whether a substance is an element, a compound, or a mixture. Understanding these classifications is essential for making sense of the world around us, from the minerals mined in Ghana to the life-saving medicines produced in our factories.

## Main Content
### Elements
An **element** is a pure substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. Each element is made up of only one type of atom. Some common elements you might recognize are:
- Oxygen (O)
- Carbon (C) 
- Iron (Fe)
- Gold (Au)

Elements are represented by unique **chemical symbols**, usually one or two letters derived from their English or Latin names. For example, the symbol for sodium is Na, from the Latin word "natrium."

Ghana is rich in mineral resources, including elements like gold, bauxite (containing aluminum), and manganese. These elements are mined and used in various industries.

### Compounds
A **compound** is a pure substance made up of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio. The elements in a compound are bonded together and can only be separated by chemical means. For example:
- Water (H2O) is a compound made up of hydrogen and oxygen bonded together
- Table salt (NaCl) is a compound of sodium and chlorine
- Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a compound of carbon and oxygen

Compounds have properties that differ from those of the individual elements they contain. For instance, sodium is a reactive metal and chlorine is a poisonous gas, but together they form table salt, which is a stable compound essential for human life.

### Mixtures
A **mixture** is a material made up of two or more substances that are not chemically bonded. The substances in a mixture retain their individual properties and can be separated by physical means. Mixtures can be either homogeneous (uniform composition throughout) or heterogeneous (non-uniform composition). Some examples of mixtures include:
- Air (a homogeneous mixture of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide)
- Concrete (a heterogeneous mixture of cement, sand, gravel, and water)
- Cocoa powder (a heterogeneous mixture of various compounds)

| Homogeneous Mixtures | Heterogeneous Mixtures |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Air                  | Concrete                |
| Brass (alloy of copper and zinc) | Oil and water           |
| Saltwater            | Sand and gravel         |

Mixtures can be separated by physical methods like:
- Filtration (e.g., using a sieve to separate sand and gravel)
- Evaporation (e.g., obtaining salt from seawater)
- Distillation (e.g., purifying water)
- Chromatography (e.g., separating pigments in plants)

### Practical Example: Separating a Mixture
Let's try separating a mixture of sand and salt:
1. Add the mixture to a beaker of water and stir until the salt dissolves.
2. Pour the mixture through a filter paper into another beaker. The sand will remain on the filter paper while the saltwater passes through.
3. Heat the saltwater in a pot until the water evaporates, leaving behind the salt.

This simple experiment demonstrates how we can use the different properties of substances in a mixture to separate them.

## Worked Examples
1. Classify each of the following as an element, compound, or mixture:
   a) Aluminum (Al) - Element
   b) Ammonia (NH3) - Compound
   c) Brass (an alloy of copper and zinc) - Mixture

2. A 50g sample of a mixture contains 15g of sand and 35g of salt. Calculate the percentage composition of the mixture.
   - Sand: (15g / 50g) × 100 = 30%
   - Salt: (35g / 50g) × 100 = 70%

## Summary
- Elements are pure substances made up of one type of atom, represented by unique chemical symbols.
- Compounds are pure substances made up of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio.
- Mixtures are materials made up of two or more substances that are not chemically bonded and can be separated by physical means.
- Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform) or heterogeneous (non-uniform).
- Physical methods like filtration, evaporation, distillation, and chromatography can be used to separate mixtures.
- Ghana's natural resources include many important elements and compounds.
