## Section: Statistical Diagrams

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Interpret and analyze data from bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs
2. Construct accurate bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs from given data
3. Calculate angles and percentages for sectors in a pie chart

## Introduction
Data analysis plays a crucial role in our daily lives as Ghanaian students. Imagine you are at the market, and you want to compare the prices of different fruits sold by various vendors. You can create a bar chart to visualize the prices and make an informed decision on where to buy your fruits. When managing your mobile money account, you might want to analyze your spending habits over the past few months. A pie chart can help you understand what percentage of your money goes towards different expenses like school fees, food, and entertainment. As you prepare for your BECE exams, you can use line graphs to track your progress and identify areas where you need to improve. By mastering the skills of interpreting and creating statistical diagrams, you will be well-equipped to tackle real-life problems and excel in your exams.

## Main Content
### Types of Statistical Diagrams
There are three main types of statistical diagrams that you will encounter in the BECE:
1. **Bar Charts**: Used to compare discrete categories or values
2. **Pie Charts**: Used to show the proportion or percentage of different categories in a whole
3. **Line Graphs**: Used to display continuous data or trends over time

### Constructing Statistical Diagrams
To construct accurate statistical diagrams, follow these steps:
1. Identify the type of data and choose an appropriate diagram
2. Organize and tabulate the data, calculating percentages or angles if necessary
3. Draw and label the axes (bar charts, line graphs) or circle (pie charts)
4. Plot the data points or draw the bars/sectors
5. Add a title, labels, and a legend if needed

### Interpreting Statistical Diagrams
When interpreting statistical diagrams, consider the following:
- The title and labels to understand what the diagram represents
- The units of measurement on the axes or in the legend
- The relative sizes or heights of bars, sectors, or lines to compare values
- Any trends, patterns, or outliers in the data

### Solving BECE-style Questions
To solve BECE-style questions involving statistical diagrams:
1. Read the question carefully and identify the given information
2. Determine the type of diagram and the data being represented
3. Analyze the diagram to find the required values or percentages
4. Perform any necessary calculations
5. Write your answer clearly with the appropriate units

## Worked Examples
1. The pie chart below shows the distribution of crops grown by a farmer in Ghana. If the farmer has a total of 60 hectares of land, calculate the area used for growing maize.

[IMAGE: Pie chart with sectors for Maize (120°), Yam (90°), Cassava (60°), and Plantain (90°)]

Step 1: Identify the angle for the maize sector, which is 120°.
Step 2: Calculate the fraction of the total land used for maize:
$\frac{120°}{360°} = \frac{1}{3}$
Step 3: Multiply the fraction by the total land area:
$\frac{1}{3} \times 60\text{ hectares} = 20\text{ hectares}$

Therefore, the farmer uses 20 hectares of land for growing maize.

2. The table below shows the monthly sales of a mobile money vendor in Ghana for the first quarter of the year. Construct a bar chart to represent the data.

| Month    | Sales (GH₵) |
|----------|-------------|
| January  | 5,000       |
| February | 7,500       |
| March    | 6,200       |

Step 1: Draw and label the axes, with months on the x-axis and sales on the y-axis.
Step 2: Choose an appropriate scale for the y-axis, e.g., 0 to 8,000 in intervals of 1,000.
Step 3: Draw bars for each month with the corresponding heights based on the sales data.
Step 4: Add a title, labels, and units.

3. The line graph below shows the number of BECE students in a school over five years. Calculate the percentage increase in the number of students between 2015 and 2019.

[IMAGE: Line graph with points for 2015 (200), 2016 (220), 2017 (240), 2018 (250), and 2019 (300)]

Step 1: Identify the number of students in 2015 (200) and 2019 (300).
Step 2: Calculate the increase in the number of students:
$300 - 200 = 100$
Step 3: Calculate the percentage increase:
$\frac{100}{200} \times 100\% = 50\%$

Therefore, the number of BECE students increased by 50% between 2015 and 2019.

## Practice Problems
1. The table below shows the distribution of blood groups among students in a Ghanaian school. Construct a pie chart to represent the data.

| Blood Group | Number of Students |
|-------------|-------------------
| A           | 60                |
| B           | 45                |
| AB          | 15                |
| O           | 80                |

2. The bar chart below shows the number of mangoes sold by a vendor over five days. On which day did the vendor sell the highest number of mangoes?

3. The line graph below shows the distance traveled by a taxi driver in Accra over six hours. Calculate the average speed of the taxi driver in km/h.

[IMAGE: Line graph with points for 0h (0 km), 1h (40 km), 2h (70 km), 3h (100 km), 4h (120 km), 5h (150 km), and 6h (180 km)]
