## Introduction
Kofi and Ama were walking home from their JHS in Kumasi when they witnessed a group of students bullying a younger boy. They felt upset and confused, wondering why someone would treat another person so poorly. At school the next day, their RME teacher, Mr. Mensah, began a lesson on the important topic of violence and bullying in Ghanaian society. 

As Mr. Mensah explained, violence and bullying are serious moral issues that affect many young people in Ghana. Whether in schools, communities, or online, these harmful behaviors go against the teachings of Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African Religion, which all promote peace, respect, and compassion for others. By learning about these issues, Kofi, Ama, and their classmates can help create a more positive and inclusive society for all Ghanaians.

**Violence** refers to the use of physical force to harm, damage, or kill someone or something. It can include actions such as hitting, kicking, or using weapons. **Bullying** is a form of violence that involves repeated, intentional acts of aggression or intimidation towards someone who is perceived as weaker or more vulnerable. Bullying can be physical, verbal, social, or online (cyberbullying).

### Religious and Moral Teachings Against Violence and Bullying

| Islam | "None of you believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself" (Hadith) |
| Traditional African Religion | Values of community, respect, and harmony among all people |

These teachings emphasize the importance of treating others with kindness, respect, and empathy, rather than causing harm or distress.

## Examples
1. Abena, a Form 2 student in Accra, was repeatedly teased and excluded by her classmates because of her appearance. She became withdrawn and struggled in school. With the help of her RME teacher and school counselor, Abena learned to assert herself and find supportive friends, while the bullies were disciplined and educated about the harm of their actions.

2. Kwame, a JHS student in a small village, witnessed his older brother being physically assaulted by a group of young men. Remembering the teachings of his imam about the importance of peace and nonviolence, Kwame sought help from community leaders to address the issue and promote reconciliation, rather than retaliation.
