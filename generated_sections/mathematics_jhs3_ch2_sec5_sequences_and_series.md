## Introduction
Sequences and series are important mathematical concepts that have many applications in everyday life. In Ghana, we can see examples of sequences and series in various contexts. For instance, when you go to the market to buy items, the prices of the items might form an arithmetic or geometric sequence. If you save a fixed amount of money every week in your mobile money account, the total savings will form an arithmetic series. In farming, the number of crops harvested each year might grow in a geometric sequence. Understanding sequences and series will also help you solve problems in the BECE and WAEC exams.

## Main Content
### Arithmetic Sequences and Series
An **arithmetic sequence** is a sequence of numbers where the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the **common difference**, usually denoted by **d**. The general term (nth term) of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:

$a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$

where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $d$ is the common difference.

An **arithmetic series** is the sum of the terms in an arithmetic sequence. The sum of the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:

$S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d]$

where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $d$ is the common difference.

| Term | Formula |
|------|---------|
| nth term of an arithmetic sequence | $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ |
| Sum of first n terms of an arithmetic series | $S_n = \frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d]$ |

### Geometric Sequences and Series
A **geometric sequence** is a sequence of numbers where the ratio between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant ratio is called the **common ratio**, usually denoted by **r**. The general term (nth term) of a geometric sequence is given by the formula:

$a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$

where $a_n$ is the nth term, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the term number, and $r$ is the common ratio.

A **geometric series** is the sum of the terms in a geometric sequence. The sum of the first $n$ terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:

$S_n = \frac{a_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}$ for $r \neq 1$

where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a_1$ is the first term, $n$ is the number of terms, and $r$ is the common ratio.

| Term | Formula |
|------|---------|
| nth term of a geometric sequence | $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{n-1}$ |
| Sum of first n terms of a geometric series | $S_n = \frac{a_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}$ for $r \neq 1$ |

### Solving Problems with Sequences and Series
To solve problems involving sequences and series, follow these steps:
1. Identify whether the sequence is arithmetic or geometric.
2. Find the common difference (d) or common ratio (r).
3. Determine the first term (a₁) and the number of terms (n) if given.
4. Use the appropriate formula to find the nth term or the sum of the first n terms.
5. Interpret the result in the context of the problem.

## Worked Examples
### Example 1
Kofi saves GH₵50 in his mobile money account in the first week. He increases his savings by GH₵10 each week. How much will Kofi save in the 12th week?

Solution:
1. The sequence of Kofi's savings is arithmetic, with a common difference of GH₵10.
2. $d$ = GH₵10
3. $a_1$ = GH₵50, $n$ = 12
4. Using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
   
   $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$
   $a_{12} = 50 + (12-1)10$
   $a_{12} = 50 + 110 = 160$

5. Kofi will save GH₵160 in the 12th week.

### Example 2
Ama has a chain with 10 white beads followed by 16 red beads, 24 blue beads, and so on, forming a geometric sequence. Find the total number of beads in the chain.

Solution:
1. The number of beads forms a geometric sequence.
2. $r$ = 16 ÷ 10 = 1.6
3. $a_1$ = 10, $n$ = 3 (3 colors)
4. Using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series:

   $S_n = \frac{a_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}$
   $S_3 = \frac{10(1-1.6^3)}{1-1.6}$
   $S_3 = \frac{10(1-4.096)}{-0.6}$
   $S_3 = \frac{-30.96}{-0.6} = 51.6$

5. There are 52 beads in total (rounding up).

## Practice Problems
1. The first term of an arithmetic sequence is 5, and the common difference is 3. Find the 20th term of the sequence.
2. In a geometric sequence, the first term is 2, and the common ratio is 1/2. Calculate the sum of the first 10 terms of the series.
3. Kwame starts a business selling plantain chips. In the first month, he sells 500 packs. Each month, his sales increase by 15% compared to the previous month. How many packs will Kwame sell in the 6th month? (Round to the nearest whole number.)
