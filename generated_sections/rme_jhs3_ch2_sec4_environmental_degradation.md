## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Define environmental degradation and list 3 main causes in Ghana
2. Explain the moral and religious responsibilities to care for the environment in Christianity, Islam, and Traditional African Religion
3. Identify 4 negative impacts of environmental degradation on Ghanaian society

## Introduction
Kofi and Ama live in Kumasi, Ghana's second largest city. On their way to school each day, they notice the increasing amount of litter and pollution in the streets and gutters. At church and mosque, their religious leaders teach about the importance of caring for God's creation. In their village, the elders share Traditional African Religious values of living in harmony with nature.

As Ghana develops, environmental degradation is a growing moral concern for the religiously diverse society. Students like Kofi and Ama have a responsibility to understand the causes, impacts, and practical solutions to this issue from both moral and religious perspectives.

### Religious Views on the Environment
The three major religious traditions in Ghana all emphasize the moral responsibility to care for the environment:

| Religion | Teaching on the Environment |
|----------|----------------------------|
| Christianity | God created the earth and humans have a duty to be good stewards of creation (Genesis 1:26-28) |  
| Islam | Allah created the world as a trust (amana) and humans are trustees (khalifa) who will be accountable for their treatment of the environment (Quran 6:165) |
| Traditional African Religion | There is a sacred bond between humans and nature. Humans must live in harmony with the environment and the spirits that inhabit it |

### Impacts of Environmental Degradation
Environmental degradation has many negative impacts on Ghanaian society:
- Health problems from air and water pollution 
- Loss of livelihoods due to depleted natural resources
- Increased risk of natural disasters like flooding and droughts
- Loss of biodiversity and destruction of ecosystems
- Threats to food security from soil degradation

### Taking Action
As young Ghanaians, JHS students have a moral and religious duty to help protect the environment. Some practical actions include:
1. Refusing, reducing, reusing and recycling waste
2. Planting trees in your school, home or community 
3. Educating others about the importance of caring for the environment  
4. Supporting local environmental protection initiatives

## Examples
- A group of Muslim students in Accra organized a community clean-up and tree planting project around their neighborhood mosque. They educated the congregation about Islam's teachings on environmental responsibility.

- A Christian JHS in Kumasi started an eco-club where students learn about recycling and composting. They sell the compost to support tree planting on the school grounds and share their knowledge with the local church.

- In a rural village, Traditional African Religious elders and youth came together to protest against illegal mining activities on their sacred lands. They invoked the community's ancestral values of respecting nature and protecting the environment for future generations.

## Summary
- Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the natural environment caused by human activities like deforestation, pollution, and illegal mining.

- Christianity, Islam and Traditional African Religion all teach moral and religious responsibilities to care for the environment as God's creation and a sacred trust.

- Environmental degradation negatively impacts Ghanaian society through health problems, loss of livelihoods, increased natural disasters, and threats to biodiversity and food security.

- Ghanaian JHS students can take practical actions to protect the environment such as reducing waste, planting trees, educating others, and supporting local initiatives.

- An environmentally sustainable future for Ghana requires the active participation of religiously diverse youth who are guided by their moral and religious values to be responsible stewards of the environment.
