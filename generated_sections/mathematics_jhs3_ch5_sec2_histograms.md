## Introduction
Data analysis is an essential part of mathematics that helps us understand and interpret information in our daily lives. In Ghana, data analysis is used in various ways, such as calculating profits at the market, tracking mobile money transactions, and measuring crop yields in farming. Histograms are a powerful tool for visualizing and analyzing data, allowing us to identify patterns and make informed decisions.

Preparing for the BECE exam requires a solid understanding of data analysis concepts, including histograms. By mastering the skills in this section, you will be well-equipped to tackle BECE questions and apply your knowledge to real-life situations in Ghana.

## Main Content
### What is a Histogram?
A **histogram** is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It consists of rectangular bars that represent the frequency or count of data values within specific intervals, called **classes** or **bins**. The height of each bar represents the frequency or count of data values in that class.

### Constructing a Histogram
To construct a histogram, follow these steps:
1. Determine the range of the dataset by finding the minimum and maximum values.
2. Decide on the number of classes (bins) and calculate the class width using the formula:

   $Class Width = \frac{Range}{Number of Classes}$

3. Create a frequency table with the classes and their corresponding frequencies.
4. Draw the x-axis and label it with the classes.
5. Draw the y-axis and label it with the frequencies.
6. Plot the rectangular bars for each class, with the height representing the frequency.

| Class | Frequency |
|-------|-----------|
| 0-9   | 5         |
| 10-19 | 12        |
| 20-29 | 8         |
| 30-39 | 3         |
| 40-49 | 2         |

### Interpreting a Histogram
When analyzing a histogram, consider the following:
- The **shape** of the distribution (symmetric, skewed left, skewed right, or bimodal)
- The **center** of the distribution (mean, median, or mode)
- The **spread** of the distribution (range, interquartile range, or standard deviation)

### Choosing the Number of Classes
To determine the appropriate number of classes for a histogram, consider the following guidelines:
- Use between 5 and 15 classes, depending on the size of the dataset
- Ensure that the class width is not too small or too large
- Use a class width that is easy to interpret and work with (e.g., multiples of 2, 5, or 10)

## Worked Examples
1. The daily sales (in GH₵) at a market stall for a week are: 120, 95, 150, 110, 130, 90, 105. Construct a histogram with 4 classes.

   **Solution:**
   * Range = 150 - 90 = 60
   * Class Width = 60 ÷ 4 = 15

   | Class    | Frequency |
   |----------|-----------|
   | 90-104   | 2         |
   | 105-119  | 2         |
   | 120-134  | 2         |
   | 135-149  | 0         |
   | 150-164  | 1         |

2. The weights (in kg) of 20 bags of rice are: 50, 52, 48, 55, 50, 51, 49, 54, 53, 50, 51, 52, 49, 48, 54, 55, 50, 52, 51, 53. Construct a histogram with an appropriate number of classes.

   **Solution:**
   * Range = 55 - 48 = 7
   * Number of classes = 5 (chosen for easy interpretation)
   * Class Width = 7 ÷ 5 ≈ 1.4 (rounded to 2 for simplicity)

   | Class  | Frequency |
   |--------|-----------|
   | 48-49  | 4         |
   | 50-51  | 7         |
   | 52-53  | 6         |
   | 54-55  | 3         |

3. A mobile money agent records the following transactions (in GH₵) for a day: 20, 50, 30, 100, 80, 60, 90, 40, 70, 50, 30, 20, 60, 80, 90. Construct a histogram and describe the shape of the distribution.

   **Solution:**
   * Range = 100 - 20 = 80
   * Number of classes = 5 (chosen for easy interpretation)
   * Class Width = 80 ÷ 5 = 16

   | Class  | Frequency |
   |--------|-----------|
   | 20-35  | 3         |
   | 36-51  | 3         |
   | 52-67  | 2         |
   | 68-83  | 3         |
   | 84-99  | 2         |
   | 100-115| 1         |

   The shape of the distribution is slightly skewed right, with a peak in the 20-35 and 36-51 classes, and a single high value in the 100-115 class.
