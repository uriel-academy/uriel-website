## Introduction
Statistics play a crucial role in our daily lives, especially in a country like Ghana. Imagine you are at the market, and you want to compare the prices of different vendors selling the same product. By analyzing the range of prices, you can make an informed decision about which vendor offers the best deal. Similarly, when preparing for the BECE exams, understanding the range and quartiles of your practice scores can help you gauge your performance and identify areas for improvement.

In this section, we will explore the concepts of range and quartiles, which are essential tools in statistics. These concepts will not only help you in your mathematics exams but also in real-life situations, such as managing your mobile money transactions or estimating crop yields on a farm.

## Main Content
### Range
The **range** of a set of numbers is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the set. It gives us an idea of how spread out the data is. To calculate the range, we use the following formula:

Range = Maximum value - Minimum value

For example, let's say you have the following set of numbers representing the prices of a bag of rice (in GH₵) from different vendors at the market:

{25, 30, 28, 32, 27}

The maximum value is 32, and the minimum value is 25. Therefore, the range is:

Range = 32 - 25 = 7

This means that the prices of a bag of rice vary by GH₵7 among the different vendors.

### Median
The **median** is the middle value in a sorted set of numbers. If the set has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

To find the median:
1. Arrange the data in ascending or descending order
2. If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle value
3. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle values

Let's find the median of the prices of a bag of rice from the previous example:

{25, 27, 28, 30, 32}

Since there are 5 values (an odd number), the median is the middle value, which is 28.

### Quartiles
**Quartiles** divide a sorted data set into four equal parts. There are three quartiles: the lower quartile (Q1), the median (Q2), and the upper quartile (Q3).

To find the quartiles:
1. Arrange the data in ascending or descending order
2. Find the median (Q2)
3. The lower quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of the data
4. The upper quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of the data

Let's find the quartiles of the following set of BECE scores:

{60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95}

First, we find the median (Q2):
- Median (Q2) = (75 + 80) ÷ 2 = 77.5

Now, we find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3):
- Lower quartile (Q1) = (65 + 70) ÷ 2 = 67.5
- Upper quartile (Q3) = (85 + 90) ÷ 2 = 87.5

This means that:
- 25% of the scores are less than or equal to 67.5
- 50% of the scores are less than or equal to 77.5
- 75% of the scores are less than or equal to 87.5

## Worked Examples
1. A farmer records the weights (in kg) of 7 randomly selected cocoa sacks: {58, 62, 60, 59, 63, 61, 60}. Calculate the range of the weights.

[IMAGE: A sketch of 7 cocoa sacks with their weights labeled]

Solution:
First, let's arrange the weights in ascending order:
{58, 59, 60, 60, 61, 62, 63}

Now, we can find the minimum and maximum values:
- Minimum value = 58
- Maximum value = 63

Using the range formula:
Range = Maximum value - Minimum value
Range = 63 - 58 = 5

Therefore, the range of the cocoa sack weights is 5 kg.

2. The daily sales (in GH₵) at a mobile money shop for a week are: {520, 480, 550, 490, 530, 570, 500}. Find the median of the daily sales.

Solution:
First, let's arrange the sales in ascending order:
{480, 490, 500, 520, 530, 550, 570}

Since there are 7 values (an odd number), the median is the middle value (the 4th value):
Median = 520

Therefore, the median of the daily sales is GH₵520.

3. The distances (in km) traveled by a taxi driver each day for 8 days are: {120, 130, 110, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180}. Find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3) of the distances traveled.

[IMAGE: A table showing the distances traveled by the taxi driver each day]

Solution:
First, let's arrange the distances in ascending order:
{110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180}

Now, we find the median (Q2):
Median (Q2) = (140 + 150) ÷ 2 = 145

To find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3):
- Lower quartile (Q1) = (120 + 130) ÷ 2 = 125
- Upper quartile (Q3) = (160 + 170) ÷ 2 = 165

Therefore, the lower quartile (Q1) is 125 km, and the upper quartile (Q3) is 165 km.

## Practice Problems
1. The ages of 9 students in a class are: {12, 13, 11, 14, 12, 13, 12, 11, 13}. Calculate the range of the ages.

2. The scores of 10 students on a BECE practice test are: {80, 85, 90, 75, 95, 70, 85, 80, 90, 75}. Find the median score.

3. The heights (in cm) of 12 plants in a garden are: {50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105}. Find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3) of the plant heights.

Answers:
1. Range = 3
2. Median = 82.5
3. Q1 = 62.5, Q3 = 92.5
