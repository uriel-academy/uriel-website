## Introduction
Measurements and units play a crucial role in our daily lives, from the cocoa farmer measuring the weight of their harvest to the engineer designing the Akosombo Dam on the Volta River. In Ghana, we use measurements to monitor the growth of our crops, track the spread of tropical diseases, and study the diverse plants and animals in our ecosystems. As young scientists, it is essential to understand the fundamentals of measurements and units to accurately describe and analyze the world around us.

In this section, we will explore the International System of Units (SI) and learn how to convert between different units of measurement. We will also introduce the concept of density and its importance in understanding the properties of matter. By mastering these concepts, you will be well-equipped to investigate the scientific phenomena that shape our lives in Ghana.

## Main Content
### The International System of Units (SI)
The **International System of Units (SI)** is a standardized system of measurement used by scientists worldwide. The SI consists of seven base units, which are:

| Quantity | Unit Name | Unit Symbol |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Length   | meter     | m           |
| Mass     | kilogram  | kg          |
| Time     | second    | s           |
| Temperature | kelvin | K           |
| Amount of substance | mole | mol     |
| Electric current | ampere | A        |
| Luminous intensity | candela | cd   |

All other units can be derived from these base units. For example, the unit for volume, the liter (L), is derived from the base unit for length, the meter (m).

### Unit Conversions
In scientific investigations, it is often necessary to convert between different units of measurement. To do this, we use **conversion factors**. A conversion factor is a ratio that expresses the relationship between two units of measurement.

For example, to convert from kilometers (km) to meters (m), we use the conversion factor:

1 km = 1,000 m

To convert 5 km to meters, we multiply 5 km by the conversion factor:

5 km × (1,000 m / 1 km) = 5,000 m

### Density
**Density** is a physical property of matter that describes the relationship between an object's mass and volume. It is calculated using the formula:

density = mass / volume

The SI unit for density is kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m³). However, for convenience, we often use grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³) for solids and grams per milliliter (g/mL) for liquids.

### Experiment: Measuring the Density of Local Materials
To better understand density, let's conduct an experiment using materials found in Ghana.

Materials:
- A measuring cup or graduated cylinder
- A digital scale
- Samples of local materials (e.g., cocoa beans, palm oil, water from the Volta River)

Procedure:
1. Measure the mass of each sample using the digital scale and record the results.
2. Measure the volume of each sample using the measuring cup or graduated cylinder and record the results.
3. Calculate the density of each sample using the formula: density = mass / volume.
4. Record your results in a table:

| Sample | Mass (g) | Volume (mL) | Density (g/mL) |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Cocoa beans | | | |
| Palm oil | | | |
| Volta River water | | | |

5. Compare the densities of the different materials and discuss your findings.

## Worked Examples
1. Convert 2.5 kg to grams (g).

Conversion factor: 1 kg = 1,000 g
2.5 kg × (1,000 g / 1 kg) = 2,500 g

2. Calculate the density of a gold nugget with a mass of 100 g and a volume of 5.23 cm³.

density = mass / volume
density = 100 g / 5.23 cm³
density = 19.12 g/cm³

## Summary
- Measurements and units are essential for accurate scientific investigations.
- The International System of Units (SI) consists of seven base units: meter, kilogram, second, kelvin, mole, ampere, and candela.
- Conversion factors are used to convert between different units of measurement.
- Density is a physical property of matter, calculated using the formula: density = mass / volume.
- Experiments using local materials can help students better understand scientific concepts like density.
