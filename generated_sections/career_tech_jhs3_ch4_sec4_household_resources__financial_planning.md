Financial planning is an essential life skill that everyone should learn, especially as you prepare to enter the workforce and start your own households. Imagine you are a successful entrepreneur like Nana Aba, who started her own catering business in Accra.

She must track her income and expenses, save for future goals, and make wise spending decisions. Whether you want to be an entrepreneur, work as a skilled tradesperson like a carpenter or seamstress, or sell goods in the market, the financial planning skills you'll learn in this lesson will help you manage your money effectively and achieve your dreams.

## Main Content
### Creating a Household Budget
A household budget is a plan that helps you track your income and expenses. To create a budget:
1. List all sources of income, such as salaries, profits from a business, or money received from family.
2. List all expenses, including:
   - Fixed expenses (rent, school fees, transportation)
   - Variable expenses (food, clothing, entertainment)
   - Savings (money set aside for future goals or emergencies)
3. Subtract your total expenses from your total income to see if you have a surplus (extra money) or a deficit (not enough money to cover expenses).
4. Adjust your expenses or find ways to increase your income to create a balanced budget.

### Saving Money and Reducing Expenses
To save money and reduce household expenses:
- Buy in bulk when possible to get better prices on items like rice, oil, and soap.
- Compare prices at different markets and shops to find the best deals.
- Repair and mend clothing and household items instead of buying new ones.
- Turn off lights and appliances when not in use to save on electricity.
- Use public transportation, walk, or bike instead of taking taxis or tro-tros.

### Setting Financial Goals and Planning for the Future
Setting financial goals helps you plan for the future and make better spending decisions. Some examples of financial goals are:
- Saving money to start a business
- Paying for education or training to improve job skills
- Buying a house or land
- Saving for retirement

To set and achieve financial goals:
1. Write down your specific goals and the amount of money needed for each.
2. Determine how much time you have to save for each goal.
3. Calculate how much money you need to save each month or year to reach your goals.
4. Include these savings amounts in your budget and adjust your expenses if needed.
5. Track your progress regularly and celebrate when you achieve a goal.

### Making Informed Spending Decisions
Making informed spending decisions means thinking carefully about how you use your money. Before making a purchase, ask yourself:
- Is this a need or a want?
- Can I afford this item?
- Have I compared prices to find the best deal?
- Will this purchase help me achieve my financial goals?

By answering these questions, you can avoid overspending and make sure your money is being used wisely.

## Practical Activity
1. Create a personal budget for a month using the following information:
   - Income: 500 Ghana cedis from a part-time job
   - Fixed expenses: 150 Ghana cedis for school fees and transportation
   - Variable expenses: 200 Ghana cedis for food, 50 Ghana cedis for clothing, 20 Ghana cedis for entertainment
   - Savings goal: 50 Ghana cedis per month to buy a new sewing machine in 6 months

   Materials needed:
   - Pen and paper or a notebook
   - Calculator (optional)

   Instructions:
   1. Write down your total income for the month.
   2. List your fixed expenses, variable expenses, and savings goal.
   3. Add up your total expenses and subtract them from your income.
   4. If you have a surplus, decide how to allocate the extra money (save more, spend on wants, etc.). If you have a deficit, find ways to reduce your expenses or increase your income.

   Expected outcome: A balanced budget that includes savings for your goal.

2. Practice making informed spending decisions:
   - Make a list of three items you want to purchase, such as a new shirt, a snack, or a book.
   - Research the prices of each item at three different shops or markets.
   - Decide which option is the best value based on price, quality, and your budget.
   - Reflect on whether each purchase is a need or a want and if it fits into your financial goals.
