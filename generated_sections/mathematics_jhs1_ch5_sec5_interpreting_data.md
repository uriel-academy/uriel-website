## Introduction
In our daily lives, we often encounter various forms of data, whether it's the prices of goods at the market, the amount of mobile money transactions, or the yields from a farm. Being able to interpret and analyze this data is a crucial skill that can help us make informed decisions. For instance, a farmer in Ghana might want to know the average yield of their crops over the past few years to plan for the future. Similarly, understanding how to interpret graphs and charts can be invaluable when preparing for the BECE exams, as these questions often appear in the mathematics section.

As we delve into the world of statistics, we will learn how to make sense of data, calculate important measures, and represent information visually. By mastering these concepts, you will not only be better prepared for your exams but also develop essential skills that will serve you well in your future careers and personal lives.

## Main Content

### Types of Data
There are two main types of data:
1. **Qualitative data**: This type of data describes qualities or characteristics, such as colors, categories, or names. For example, the types of crops grown on a farm (e.g., maize, yam, cassava) are qualitative data.
2. **Quantitative data**: This type of data is numerical and can be measured or counted. For example, the weights of bags of rice in kilograms or the amount of money earned from selling goods are quantitative data.

### Measures of Central Tendency
Measures of central tendency help us describe the typical or central value in a dataset. The three main measures are:

1. **Mean**: The arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values.

   $\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}$

2. **Median**: The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

3. **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes.

For example, consider the following dataset representing the ages of students in a class:
14, 15, 14, 16, 15, 14, 15, 16, 14, 15

- The mean age is $\frac{14 + 15 + 14 + 16 + 15 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 14 + 15}{10} = 14.8$ years
- The median age is 15 years (the average of the two middle values, 15 and 15)
- The mode is 14 years (appears most frequently)

### Range
The **range** is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides a measure of how spread out the data is.

$\text{Range} = \text{Largest value} - \text{Smallest value}$

For the age dataset above, the range is $16 - 14 = 2$ years.

### Graphical Representations of Data

Data can be represented visually using various types of graphs and charts, such as:

1. **Bar graphs**: Used to compare categories or discrete values. The height of each bar represents the frequency or value of the corresponding category.

   [IMAGE: A bar graph showing the number of students in each grade level (JHS 1, JHS 2, JHS 3) at a school in Ghana]

2. **Pie charts**: Used to show the proportion or percentage of each category in a whole. Each slice of the pie represents a category, and the size of the slice is proportional to its percentage of the total.

3. **Line graphs**: Used to display trends or changes over time. The independent variable (usually time) is on the x-axis, and the dependent variable (the value being measured) is on the y-axis.

   [IMAGE: A line graph showing the change in the price of a bag of cement in Ghana over a 6-month period]

## Worked Examples

1. The table below shows the distribution of mobile money transactions in a small Ghanaian town over a week:

   | Day       | Number of Transactions |
   |-----------|------------------------|
   | Monday    | 25                     |
   | Tuesday   | 30                     |
   | Wednesday | 28                     |
   | Thursday  | 35                     |
   | Friday    | 40                     |
   | Saturday  | 45                     |
   | Sunday    | 20                     |

   Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the number of transactions.

   **Solution:**
   
   To find the mean, add up all the values and divide by the number of days:
   $\text{Mean} = \frac{25 + 30 + 28 + 35 + 40 + 45 + 20}{7} = \frac{223}{7} = 31.86$
   
   To find the median, arrange the values in ascending order:
   20, 25, 28, 30, 35, 40, 45
   The median is the middle value, which is 30.
   
   To find the mode, look for the value that appears most frequently. In this case, each value appears only once, so there is no mode.

2. The weights (in kg) of 10 bags of rice are: 50, 52, 48, 50, 51, 49, 52, 50, 51, 47. Find the range of the weights.

   **Solution:**
   
   To find the range, subtract the smallest value from the largest value:
   
   Largest value: 52 kg
   Smallest value: 47 kg
   $\text{Range} = 52 - 47 = 5$ kg

3. A farmer in Ghana recorded the number of eggs collected from their chicken coop over a period of 5 days: 15, 18, 20, 16, 19. Draw a bar graph to represent this data.

   **Solution:**

   [IMAGE: A bar graph with the days (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) on the x-axis and the number of eggs on the y-axis. The heights of the bars correspond to the number of eggs collected each day: 15, 18, 20, 16, 19.]

## Practice Problems

1. Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the following set of scores: 85, 90, 78, 92, 88, 90, 85, 93, 90.

2. The prices of five items in a Ghanaian market are: GH₵12, GH₵8, GH₵15, GH₵10, and GH₵12. Find the range of the prices.

3. Draw a pie chart to represent the distribution of colors in a bag of candy: 20% red, 30% green, 25% blue, 15% yellow, 10% orange.

4. The table below shows the number of students in each grade level at a Ghanaian school:

   | Grade Level | Number of Students |
   |-------------|--------------------| 
   | JHS 1       | 120                |
   | JHS 2       | 100                |
   | JHS 3       | 110                |

   Draw a bar graph to represent this data.

**Answers:**
1. Mean: 88.78, Median: 90, Mode: 90
2. Range: GH₵7
