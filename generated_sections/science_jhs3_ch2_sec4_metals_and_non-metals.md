## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, students will be able to:
1. Differentiate between metals and non-metals based on their physical and chemical properties
2. Explain the reactivity series of metals and its importance in extraction processes
3. Describe the reactions of metals with water, acids, and oxygen
4. Understand the process of rusting and methods to prevent it
5. Identify common uses of metals and non-metals in Ghana

## Introduction
Metals and non-metals are essential materials in our daily lives. In Ghana, we encounter them in various aspects, from the aluminum pots used for cooking to the plastic buckets for carrying water. Metals like copper and aluminum are crucial components in the hydroelectric dam at Akosombo, which generates electricity for our country. Non-metals, such as sulfur and phosphorus, play a vital role in the production of fertilizers used in cocoa farming, one of Ghana's major agricultural industries. Understanding the properties and reactions of metals and non-metals is essential for students to appreciate their importance in our society and economy.

## Main Content
### Physical Properties of Metals and Non-metals
Metals and non-metals have distinct physical properties that set them apart. Metals are generally:
- **Lustrous**: They have a shiny appearance
- **Malleable**: Can be hammered into thin sheets
- **Ductile**: Can be drawn into wires
- Good conductors of heat and electricity

Non-metals, on the other hand, are:
- Dull in appearance
- Brittle and cannot be bent or stretched
- Poor conductors of heat and electricity (except for graphite)

### Chemical Properties and Reactivity Series
Metals react differently with water, acids, and oxygen based on their reactivity. The reactivity series is an arrangement of metals in descending order of their reactivity:

| Reactivity | Metals |
|------------|--------|
| Most reactive | Potassium, Sodium, Lithium |
| Reactive | Calcium, Magnesium, Aluminum |
| Less reactive | Zinc, Iron, Tin, Lead |
| Least reactive | Copper, Silver, Gold, Platinum |

The more reactive a metal is, the more readily it combines with other elements. For example, sodium reacts vigorously with water to form sodium hydroxide and hydrogen gas:

2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) -> 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)

### Rusting of Iron and Prevention Methods
Rusting is a common problem in Ghana due to its humid climate. It occurs when iron reacts with water and oxygen:

4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) + 6H2O(l) -> 4Fe(OH)3(s)

To prevent rusting, we can:
1. Paint or oil the iron surface
2. Galvanize iron by coating it with zinc
3. Use stainless steel, an alloy containing chromium

### Common Uses of Metals and Non-metals in Ghana
Metals and non-metals have various applications in Ghana:
- Copper wires for electrical transmission
- Aluminum for roofing sheets and cooking utensils
- Gold and silver for jewelry
- Sulfur for treating skin diseases like scabies
- Iodine for disinfecting wounds
- Carbon (charcoal) for cooking and water purification

## Worked Examples
1. Arrange the following metals in order of increasing reactivity: copper, sodium, iron, magnesium.
Answer: copper < iron < magnesium < sodium

2. Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid.
Answer: Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)

## Summary
- Metals are lustrous, malleable, ductile, and good conductors of heat and electricity, while non-metals are dull, brittle, and poor conductors.
- The reactivity series arranges metals in descending order of reactivity, with potassium being the most reactive and gold being the least reactive.
- Metals react differently with water, acids, and oxygen based on their reactivity.
- Rusting is the reaction of iron with water and oxygen, forming iron(III) hydroxide. It can be prevented by painting, galvanizing, or using stainless steel.
- Metals and non-metals have various applications in Ghana, such as electrical wiring, cooking utensils, jewelry, and water purification.
