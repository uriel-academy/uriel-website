## Introduction
Waves are all around us in Ghana, from the ripples on Lake Volta to the sound of drums at a traditional festival. Even the light from the sun that helps cocoa trees grow reaches Earth in the form of waves. Understanding wave motion is crucial for many aspects of life, such as communication through radio waves, generating electricity at the Akosombo Dam, and even diagnosing medical conditions like malaria using ultrasound. In this section, we will explore the fascinating world of waves and learn how they transfer energy without transferring matter.

## Main Content

### What are Waves?
Waves are disturbances that transfer energy from one point to another without transferring matter. They are created when a source of energy causes a medium to vibrate. Some common examples of waves include:
- Water waves on the surface of the Volta River
- Sound waves from talking drums
- Light waves from the sun
- Radio waves used for communication

### Types of Waves
There are two main types of waves: **transverse waves** and **longitudinal waves**.

1. Transverse Waves:
   - In transverse waves, the particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.
   - Examples: water waves, light waves, and vibrations on a stringed instrument like the kora.

2. Longitudinal Waves:
   - In longitudinal waves, the particles of the medium vibrate parallel to the direction of wave propagation.
   - Examples: sound waves, seismic waves during earthquakes, and waves in a slinky toy.

### Wave Properties
Waves have several properties that describe their behavior and characteristics:
- **Amplitude**: The maximum displacement of a particle from its rest position, measured in meters (m).
- **Wavelength (λ)**: The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs, measured in meters (m).
- **Frequency (f)**: The number of waves that pass a fixed point per unit time, measured in hertz (Hz).
- **Period (T)**: The time taken for one complete wave to pass a fixed point, measured in seconds (s).
- **Wave speed (v)**: The distance traveled by a wave per unit time, measured in meters per second (m/s).

These properties are related by the wave equation: 
v = f × λ

### Energy Transfer in Waves
Waves transfer energy without transferring matter. As a wave passes through a medium, the particles of the medium vibrate about their rest position, but they do not move along with the wave. This can be demonstrated with a simple experiment using a slinky:

1. Stretch a slinky between two people.
2. One person should create a longitudinal wave by quickly pushing and pulling one end of the slinky.
3. Observe how the wave travels through the slinky without the coils moving along with it.

This experiment shows that waves can transfer energy without transferring matter.

### Wave Speed and the Wave Equation
The speed of a wave depends on the properties of the medium through which it travels. The wave equation relates the speed of a wave to its frequency and wavelength:

v = f × λ

Where:
- v is the wave speed in m/s
- f is the frequency in Hz
- λ is the wavelength in m

This equation is useful for solving problems involving wave properties.

## Worked Examples

1. A sound wave has a frequency of 500 Hz and a wavelength of 0.68 m. Calculate the speed of the sound wave.
   
   Given:
   - Frequency (f) = 500 Hz
   - Wavelength (λ) = 0.68 m
   
   Using the wave equation: v = f × λ
   v = 500 Hz × 0.68 m
   v = 340 m/s

   Therefore, the speed of the sound wave is 340 m/s.

2. A water wave travels at a speed of 2.5 m/s and has a wavelength of 0.5 m. Calculate the frequency of the wave.
   
   Given:
   - Wave speed (v) = 2.5 m/s
   - Wavelength (λ) = 0.5 m
   
   Rearranging the wave equation: f = v ÷ λ
   f = 2.5 m/s ÷ 0.5 m
   f = 5 Hz

   Therefore, the frequency of the water wave is 5 Hz.

## Summary
