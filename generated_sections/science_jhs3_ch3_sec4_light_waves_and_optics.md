## Introduction
Light is all around us, from the bright sun shining over the cocoa farms in the Ashanti Region to the warm glow of a kerosene lamp illuminating a rural home in the evening. Understanding how light behaves and interacts with different materials is crucial for many aspects of our lives. In Ghana, we see the importance of light in various fields, such as agriculture, where farmers rely on sunlight for photosynthesis in their crops, and in healthcare, where doctors use microscopes and other optical devices to diagnose and treat diseases like malaria and typhoid fever.

In this section, we will explore the fascinating world of light waves and optics. We will learn about the properties of light, how it travels through different media, and how we can manipulate it using lenses and mirrors. By the end of this section, you will have a deeper understanding of the science behind the optical phenomena you encounter in your daily life and how this knowledge can be applied to solve problems and improve lives in Ghana.

## Main Content

### Properties of Light Waves
Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels in waves. Like all waves, light has several key properties:
- **Wavelength**: The distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs in a wave. Different wavelengths of light correspond to different colors.
- **Frequency**: The number of wave cycles that pass a fixed point in one second. Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength.
- **Amplitude**: The maximum displacement of a wave from its resting position. In light waves, amplitude determines the intensity or brightness of the light.

Light waves can interact with matter in various ways, including:
- **Reflection**: When light bounces off a surface, such as a mirror or a calm lake.
- **Refraction**: When light bends as it passes from one medium to another, such as from air to water.
- **Dispersion**: When white light separates into its component colors, such as in a rainbow or when light passes through a prism.

### The Human Eye and Color Perception
The human eye is an incredible optical device that allows us to perceive light and color. The main parts of the eye involved in vision are:
- **Cornea**: The transparent front part of the eye that focuses light onto the lens.
- **Lens**: A flexible, transparent structure that further focuses light onto the retina.
- **Retina**: The light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones).

Rods are responsible for low-light vision, while cones are responsible for color vision. There are three types of cones, each sensitive to a different range of wavelengths corresponding to red, green, and blue light. By combining the signals from these cones, our brain interprets the full spectrum of colors we see.

### Optical Devices
Humans have developed various optical devices that manipulate light to enhance our vision or create images. Some common optical devices include:
- **Lenses**: Transparent objects with curved surfaces that refract light, used in eyeglasses, magnifying glasses, and microscopes.
  - Converging lenses focus light to a point, making objects appear larger.
  - Diverging lenses spread light out, making objects appear smaller.
- **Mirrors**: Surfaces that reflect light, used in telescopes, periscopes, and solar cookers.
  - Plane mirrors produce virtual images that are the same size as the object.
  - Curved mirrors (concave and convex) can enlarge or reduce the apparent size of an object.
- **Camera Obscura**: A dark chamber with a small hole or lens that projects an inverted image of the outside world onto a screen. This is the basic principle behind pinhole cameras and modern cameras with lenses.

Experiment: Building a Pinhole Camera
You can build a simple pinhole camera using everyday materials:
1. Take a small cardboard box and cut a small hole (about 1 mm in diameter) in the center of one end.
2. On the opposite end, cut a larger hole and tape a piece of tracing paper or wax paper to cover it.
3. In a dark room, point the pinhole end towards a bright object or scene and observe the inverted image projected on the tracing paper screen.

This demonstrates how light travels in straight lines and how a small aperture can focus light to create an image.

## Worked Examples

1. Calculating the focal length of a lens:
   A converging lens has a focal length of 20 cm. If an object is placed 30 cm in front of the lens, where will the image be formed?

   Using the thin lens equation: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di
   where f = focal length, do = distance of the object from the lens, and di = distance of the image from the lens.

   1/20 = 1/30 + 1/di
   1/20 - 1/30 = 1/di
   (3 - 2)/(60) = 1/di
   1/60 = 1/di
   di = 60 cm

   The image will be formed 60 cm behind the lens.

2. Determining the color of light:
   A light source emits electromagnetic waves with a frequency of 6 × 10^14 Hz. What color is this light?

   Using the equation: c = λ × f
   where c = speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s), λ = wavelength, and f = frequency

   3 × 10^8 = λ × (6 × 10^14)
   λ = (3 × 10^8) / (6 × 10^14)
   λ = 5 × 10^-7 m = 500 nm

   Light with a wavelength of 500 nm appears green to the human eye.

## Summary
- Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels in waves, characterized by wavelength, frequency, and amplitude.
- Light can be reflected, refracted, and dispersed when it interacts with matter.
- The human eye perceives light and color using photoreceptor cells called rods and cones.
- Optical devices like lenses, mirrors, and camera obscuras manipulate light to enhance vision or create images.
- Understanding the properties and behavior of light is crucial for various applications in Ghana, from agriculture to healthcare.
