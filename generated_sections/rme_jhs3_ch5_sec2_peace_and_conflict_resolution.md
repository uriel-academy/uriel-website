## Introduction
Kofi and Ama, two JHS 3 students from Accra, were walking home from school one day, discussing the recent news about conflicts around the world. They wondered why people fought and how they could promote peace in their diverse community. As they passed by a mosque and a church, they realized that their Religious and Moral Education class had been teaching them valuable lessons about living harmoniously in Ghana's multi-religious society.

In this chapter, we will explore the causes of conflicts and learn how religious teachings and moral values can help us promote peace and resolve conflicts in our personal lives, communities, and the world at large.
