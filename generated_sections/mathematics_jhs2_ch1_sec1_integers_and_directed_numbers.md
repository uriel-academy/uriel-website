# Chapter 1: Numbers and Operations
## Section: Integers and Directed Numbers

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this section, students will be able to:
1. Understand the concept of integers and directed numbers
2. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers
3. Apply integer operations to solve real-world problems
4. Represent integers on a number line
5. Understand the absolute value of an integer

## Introduction
In our daily lives, we often encounter situations that involve positive and negative numbers. For example, when trading at Makola Market in Accra, a vendor might make a profit of GH₵50 on a good day, but lose GH₵20 on a slow day. These positive and negative values can be represented using integers. Understanding integers is crucial for managing personal finances, such as keeping track of your mobile money balance or calculating your net profit from selling farm produce. Additionally, mastering integer operations will help you excel in the Mathematics section of the BECE exam, which is essential for progressing to senior high school.

## Main Content
### 1. Definition of Integers and Directed Numbers
**Integers** are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. They are represented by the symbol ℤ. Examples of integers include -5, -2, 0, 3, and 7. **Directed numbers** are integers that have a specific direction or sign, either positive (+) or negative (-).

### 2. Addition and Subtraction of Integers
When adding integers with the same sign, keep the sign and add the absolute values. When adding integers with different signs, subtract the absolute values and keep the sign of the integer with the larger absolute value.

For example:
- (+5) + (+3) = +8
- (-7) + (-2) = -9
- (+6) + (-4) = +2
- (-3) + (+8) = +5

To subtract integers, add the opposite (additive inverse) of the integer being subtracted.

For example:
- (+7) - (+4) = (+7) + (-4) = +3
- (-5) - (-8) = (-5) + (+8) = +3
- (+6) - (-3) = (+6) + (+3) = +9

### 3. Multiplication and Division of Integers
When multiplying or dividing integers, follow these rules:
- The product or quotient of two integers with the same sign is positive.
- The product or quotient of two integers with different signs is negative.

For example:
- (+5) × (+3) = +15
- (-4) × (-6) = +24
- (+7) × (-2) = -14
- (-8) ÷ (+2) = -4
- (+15) ÷ (-3) = -5

### 4. Number Line Representation and Absolute Value
Integers can be represented on a number line, with positive integers to the right of zero and negative integers to the left of zero.

The **absolute value** of an integer is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of its sign. It is denoted by two vertical bars surrounding the integer. For example, |+4| = 4 and |-4| = 4.

| Property                     | Example         |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Definition                   | \|a\| = a if a ≥ 0, \|a\| = -a if a < 0 |
| Non-negativity               | \|a\| ≥ 0        |
| Distance from zero           | \|a\| = \|-a\|     |

## Worked Examples
1. A farmer in Kumasi sold 25 bags of maize for GH₵120 each and 18 bags of rice for GH₵150 each. However, 7 bags of maize were spoiled and had to be discarded, resulting in a loss of GH₵80 per bag. What was the farmer's net profit?

Profit from maize: 25 × GH₵120 = GH₵3,000
Profit from rice: 18 × GH₵150 = GH₵2,700
Loss from spoiled maize: 7 × GH₵80 = GH₵560

Net profit = Profit from maize + Profit from rice - Loss from spoiled maize
Net profit = GH₵3,000 + GH₵2,700 - GH₵560
Net profit = GH₵5,140

2. Kofi and Ama are playing a game where they earn points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect answers. Kofi earned 12 points, then lost 5 points, earned 7 points, and lost 3 points. Ama lost 4 points, earned 9 points, lost 6 points, and earned 8 points. Who has more points at the end of the game?

Kofi's points: (+12) + (-5) + (+7) + (-3) = +11 points
Ama's points: (-4) + (+9) + (-6) + (+8) = +7 points

Since +11 > +7, Kofi has more points at the end of the game.

3. Adwoa and Kwame are comparing the altitudes of two cities in Ghana. Kumasi has an altitude of 250 meters above sea level, while Tarkwa has an altitude of 78 meters below sea level. What is the difference in altitude between the two cities?

[IMAGE: A vertical number line with Kumasi at +250 m and Tarkwa at -78 m]

Difference in altitude = |Altitude of Kumasi - Altitude of Tarkwa|
Difference in altitude = |(+250) - (-78)|
Difference in altitude = |(+250) + (+78)|
Difference in altitude = |+328|
Difference in altitude = 328 meters

## Practice Problems
1. Evaluate: (-8) + (+5) - (-12) + (-3)
2. The temperature in Tamale was 4°C at 6 am. By noon, it had risen by 7°C, and by 6 pm, it had dropped by 5°C. What was the temperature at 6 pm?
3. Calculate: (-15) × (+4) ÷ (-3)

Answers:
1. +6
2. 6°C
3. +20

## Summary
- Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero.
- When adding integers, keep the sign if both integers have the same sign; otherwise, subtract the absolute values and keep the sign of the integer with the larger absolute value.
- To subtract integers, add the additive inverse of the integer being subtracted.
- The product or quotient of two integers with the same sign is positive, while the product or quotient of two integers with different signs is negative.
- The absolute value of an integer is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of its sign.
