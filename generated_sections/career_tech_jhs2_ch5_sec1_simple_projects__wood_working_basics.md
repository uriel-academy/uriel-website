### Measuring and Marking Wood
Before cutting or joining wood, you must measure and mark it accurately. Follow these steps:
1. Use a measuring tape to determine the desired length or width.
2. Hold the pencil firmly against the wood and the measuring tape.
3. Draw a straight line along the measurement, using a ruler or straight edge if needed.
4. Double-check your measurement before cutting.

### Cutting Wood
There are two main ways to cut wood: using a hand saw or a power saw. For beginners, a hand saw is a safer and more accessible option.

To cut wood with a hand saw:
1. Secure the wood firmly to a workbench or sawhorse.
2. Hold the saw at a 45-degree angle to the wood, with the blade touching the marked line.
3. Use long, steady strokes to cut along the line, letting the saw do the work.
4. Keep your hand away from the blade and maintain a firm grip on the saw handle.

**Safety tip:** Always wear safety goggles and work gloves when cutting wood to protect your eyes and hands from debris and splinters.

### Joining Wood
To create wooden projects, you'll need to join pieces of wood together. The most common methods are using nails, screws, or wood glue.

| Joining Method | Best For | Procedure |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Nails | Quick, simple projects | 1. Drill pilot holes<br>2. Drive nails with hammer<br>3. Sink nail heads slightly below wood surface |  
| Screws | Stronger, more durable joints | 1. Drill pilot holes<br>2. Drive screws with screwdriver<br>3. Countersink screw heads for flush finish |
| Wood glue | Seamless, invisible joints | 1. Apply glue evenly to both surfaces<br>2. Press and clamp pieces together tightly<br>3. Allow glue to dry completely before handling |

## Practical Activity
Now that you've learned the basics of woodworking, let's put your skills to the test by creating a simple wooden stool.

Materials needed:
- 4 wooden legs (2.5cm x 2.5cm x 30cm)
- 2 wooden support beams (2.5cm x 2.5cm x 25cm) 
- 1 wooden seat (30cm x 30cm x 2cm)
- Wood glue
- 8 wood screws (4cm long)
- Sandpaper

Instructions:
1. Sand all wooden pieces until smooth.
2. Arrange the 4 legs in a square, with the support beams connecting them at the top and middle.
3. Apply wood glue to the joints and clamp tightly. Allow glue to dry for 2 hours.
4. Drill pilot holes and drive 2 screws into each joint for added strength.
5. Center the seat on top of the leg assembly and glue in place. Clamp and allow to dry.
6. Sand any rough edges and apply a finish if desired (paint, varnish, etc.).
