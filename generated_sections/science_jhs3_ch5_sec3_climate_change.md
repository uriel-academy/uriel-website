## Climate Change

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:
1. Explain the causes and impacts of climate change, particularly in Ghana
2. Describe the greenhouse effect and the role of greenhouse gases
3. Understand the impact of human activities on climate change
4. Identify strategies to mitigate and adapt to climate change in Ghana
5. Conduct a practical experiment to demonstrate the greenhouse effect

## Introduction
Climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing our world today, and its effects are being felt right here in Ghana. From changes in rainfall patterns affecting cocoa farming to rising sea levels threatening coastal communities, the impacts of climate change are diverse and far-reaching. As young Ghanaian students, it is crucial to understand the science behind climate change and how our actions contribute to this global problem. By learning about the causes, effects, and solutions to climate change, we can take steps to protect our environment, our communities, and our future.

## Main Content
### The Greenhouse Effect
The greenhouse effect is a natural process that keeps the Earth warm enough to support life. Greenhouse gases, such as **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**, **methane (CH₄)**, and **water vapor (H₂O)**, trap heat from the sun in the Earth's atmosphere. However, human activities have significantly increased the concentration of these gases, leading to an enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming.

### Human Activities Contributing to Climate Change
1. Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy releases CO₂ into the atmosphere
2. Deforestation, particularly in tropical rainforests like those in Ghana, reduces the amount of CO₂ absorbed by trees
3. Agriculture, such as cattle farming and rice cultivation, releases methane
4. Landfills and waste management release methane as organic waste decomposes

### Impacts of Climate Change in Ghana
1. Changes in rainfall patterns affect agriculture, particularly cocoa farming
2. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities and infrastructure
3. Increasing temperatures and changing weather patterns may spread tropical diseases like malaria
4. Reduced water availability affects hydroelectric power generation, such as at the Akosombo Dam

| Impact                  | Description                                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Agricultural changes    | Shifts in rainfall and temperature affect crop yields and quality    |
| Coastal flooding        | Rising sea levels inundate low-lying areas and damage infrastructure |
| Spread of diseases      | Changing climate conditions favor the spread of vector-borne diseases|
| Reduced hydropower      | Decreased water levels in the Volta River affect electricity generation |

### Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies
Mitigation strategies aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while adaptation strategies help communities cope with the impacts of climate change.

Mitigation strategies:
- Transition to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower
- Promote energy efficiency and conservation
- Encourage reforestation and protect existing forests
- Adopt sustainable agricultural practices

Adaptation strategies:
- Develop drought-resistant and heat-tolerant crop varieties
- Implement coastal protection measures like sea walls and mangrove restoration
- Improve disease surveillance and control programs
- Diversify energy sources and improve water management

Practical Experiment: Demonstrating the Greenhouse Effect
Materials:
- Two clear plastic containers
- Two thermometers
- Soil
- Plastic wrap
- Sunlight or a strong lamp

Procedure:
1. Fill both containers with equal amounts of soil
2. Place a thermometer in each container, making sure they don't touch the soil directly
3. Cover one container tightly with plastic wrap, simulating a greenhouse gas layer
4. Place both containers in direct sunlight or under a strong lamp
5. Record the temperature in each container every 5 minutes for 30 minutes

Results:
The container covered with plastic wrap will likely have a higher temperature than the uncovered container, demonstrating the greenhouse effect.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculating Carbon Footprint
   If a family uses 50 kWh of electricity per day and their electricity has a carbon intensity of 0.5 kg CO₂ per kWh, calculate their daily carbon footprint from electricity use.

   Daily electricity consumption = 50 kWh
   Carbon intensity = 0.5 kg CO₂/kWh

   Daily carbon footprint = 50 kWh × 0.5 kg CO₂/kWh = 25 kg CO₂

2. Estimating Sea Level Rise Impact
   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that global sea levels may rise by 0.3 to 1.0 meters by 2100. If a coastal community in Ghana is 0.5 meters above current sea level, will it be submerged by 2100 under the worst-case scenario?

   Community elevation = 0.5 m
   Worst-case sea level rise = 1.0 m

   Since the worst-case sea level rise (1.0 m) is greater than the community elevation (0.5 m), the community would be submerged by 2100 under this scenario.

## Summary
- The greenhouse effect is a natural process that keeps Earth warm, but human activities have enhanced it, leading to climate change
- Burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture, and waste management are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions
- Ghana faces impacts such as changes in rainfall, sea level rise, spread of diseases, and reduced hydropower generation
- Mitigation strategies reduce emissions, while adaptation strategies help communities cope with climate change impacts
- The practical experiment demonstrates the greenhouse effect using plastic containers, soil, and thermometers
