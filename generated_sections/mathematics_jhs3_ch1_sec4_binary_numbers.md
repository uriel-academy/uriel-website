## Introduction
In our everyday lives in Ghana, we often encounter situations that involve numbers and calculations. From counting the money we earn from selling goods at the market to measuring the weight of cocoa beans on a farm, numbers play a crucial role. As students preparing for the BECE, it is essential to have a strong understanding of various number systems, including binary numbers.

Binary numbers are used extensively in computers and digital systems, which are becoming increasingly important in our modern world. Understanding binary numbers will not only help you excel in your BECE mathematics exam but also prepare you for future careers in technology and digital industries. In this section, we will explore the fascinating world of binary numbers and learn how to perform various operations with them.

## Main Content

### 1. Place Value in Binary Numbers
In the decimal number system, we use ten digits (0-9) and each position represents a power of 10. In binary, we only use two digits: 0 and 1. Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2.

For example, the binary number 1101 can be broken down as follows:
| Position | Value | Calculation |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 3        | 1     | 1 × 2³ = 8  |
| 2        | 1     | 1 × 2² = 4  |
| 1        | 0     | 0 × 2¹ = 0  |
| 0        | 1     | 1 × 2⁰ = 1  |

Therefore, the binary number 1101 is equal to the decimal number 13 (8 + 4 + 0 + 1).

### 2. Converting between Binary and Decimal
To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 2 and add the results.

To convert a decimal number to binary, divide the number by 2 repeatedly until the quotient becomes 0. The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the binary equivalent.

### 3. Binary Addition and Subtraction
Binary addition and subtraction follow similar rules to decimal operations, but with only two digits (0 and 1).

**Binary Addition:**
- 0 + 0 = 0
- 0 + 1 = 1
- 1 + 0 = 1
- 1 + 1 = 10 (carry 1 to the next position)

**Binary Subtraction:**
- 0 - 0 = 0
- 1 - 0 = 1
- 1 - 1 = 0
- 0 - 1 = 1 (borrow 1 from the next position)

### 4. Applications of Binary Numbers
Binary numbers are used in various real-world applications, such as:
- Computer data storage and processing
- Digital circuits and electronics
- Cryptography and secure communication
- Error detection and correction in data transmission

## Worked Examples

1. A farmer in the Eastern Region of Ghana has 47 bags of maize. Express this number in binary.

Step 1: Divide 47 by 2 repeatedly until the quotient becomes 0.
```
47 ÷ 2 = 23 remainder 1
23 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 1
11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1
5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1
2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1
```

Step 2: Read the remainders from bottom to top to get the binary equivalent.
47₁₀ = 101111₂

2. A mobile money agent in Accra has GH₵75 in her account. What is this amount in binary?

Step 1: Convert 75₁₀ to binary using the division method.
```
75 ÷ 2 = 37 remainder 1
37 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 1
18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0
9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1
4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0
2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0
1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1
```

Step 2: Read the remainders from bottom to top.
75₁₀ = 1001011₂

3. A student at a JHS in Kumasi solved a binary addition problem: 1011₂ + 101₂. What is the result in decimal?

Step 1: Perform binary addition.
```
  1011
+ 0101
------
 10000
```

Step 2: Convert the binary result to decimal.
10000₂ = 1 × 2⁴ + 0 × 2³ + 0 × 2² + 0 × 2¹ + 0 × 2⁰ = 16₁₀

## Practice Problems
1. Convert the decimal number 42 to binary.
2. Perform the binary subtraction: 1101₂ - 111₂.
3. A fisherman in Cape Coast caught 29 fish. Express this number in binary.

Answers:
1. 101010₂
2. 110₂
3. 11101₂
