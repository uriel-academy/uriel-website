## Introduction
In our daily lives as Ghanaian students, we often encounter situations where we need to use mathematical expressions. For example, when we go to the market to buy ingredients for our favorite dishes, we might need to calculate the total cost based on the price per unit and the number of units we buy. Similarly, when using mobile money services, we need to understand how the fees are calculated based on the amount we send or receive. 

In this chapter, we will learn about substitution in algebraic expressions, which is a crucial skill for solving real-world problems and preparing for the BECE exams. By mastering this concept, you will be able to tackle a wide range of mathematical challenges and apply your knowledge to everyday situations.

## Main Content
### What is Substitution?
**Substitution** is the process of replacing a variable in an algebraic expression with a specific value. When we substitute a value for a variable, we can evaluate the expression and find its numerical value.

For example, consider the expression $2x + 3$. If we substitute $x = 5$, the expression becomes:

$2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13$

### Simplifying Expressions after Substitution
After substituting values into an algebraic expression, we often need to simplify the resulting expression. To do this, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

For example, let's simplify the expression $3x^2 - 2(x + 1)$ when $x = 4$.

$3(4)^2 - 2(4 + 1)$
$= 3(16) - 2(5)$
$= 48 - 10$
$= 38$

### Substitution in Formulas
Substitution is often used when working with formulas. A **formula** is an equation that shows the relationship between different variables. Here are some common formulas:

| Formula | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| $A = L \times W$ | Area of a rectangle |
| $P = 2L + 2W$ | Perimeter of a rectangle |
| $d = rt$ | Distance traveled at a constant speed |

To use a formula, we substitute the given values for the variables and then evaluate the expression.

### Real-World Applications
Substitution is essential for solving real-world problems involving algebraic expressions. Here are some examples:

1. A taxi charges a flat rate of GH₵5 plus GH₵2 per kilometer traveled. If the taxi travels $x$ kilometers, the total fare can be expressed as $2x + 5$. 

2. A mobile money service charges a 1% fee for each transaction. If you send an amount $M$, the fee can be expressed as $0.01M$.

## Worked Examples
1. Evaluate the expression $4a - 3b$ when $a = 6$ and $b = 2$.

   $4(6) - 3(2)$
   $= 24 - 6$
   $= 18$

2. A rectangle has a length of $(x + 3)$ cm and a width of $(x - 1)$ cm. Find its area when $x = 5$.

   [IMAGE: A rectangle with length $(x + 3)$ cm and width $(x - 1)$ cm]

   Area $= L \times W$
   $= (x + 3)(x - 1)$

   Substitute $x = 5$:

   Area $= (5 + 3)(5 - 1)$
   $= (8)(4)$
   $= 32$ cm²

3. Kofi is planning to buy some shirts for his friends. Each shirt costs GH₵25. If he buys $n$ shirts and has a coupon for GH₵10 off his total purchase, how much will he spend in terms of $n$?

   Total cost $= 25n - 10$

   If Kofi buys 4 shirts:

   Total cost $= 25(4) - 10$
   $= 100 - 10$
   $= GH₵90$

## Practice Problems
1. Evaluate the expression $6x - 3y + 2z$ when $x = 2$, $y = 5$, and $z = 1$.

2. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula $P = 4s$, where $s$ is the length of one side. Find the perimeter when $s = 7$ cm.

3. A farmer has a rectangular plot of land with a length of $(2x + 1)$ meters and a width of $(x - 2)$ meters. Find the area of the plot when $x = 6$.

4. Adwoa wants to buy some yams at the market. Each yam costs GH₵4. She also wants to buy a bag to carry the yams, which costs GH₵8. If she buys $y$ yams, express the total cost in terms of $y$.

(Answers: 1. 8; 2. 28 cm; 3. 52 m²; 4. $4y + 8$)
