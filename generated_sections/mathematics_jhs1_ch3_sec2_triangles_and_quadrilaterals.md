## Introduction
Geometry is all around us, from the shapes of buildings in Accra to the patterns in kente cloth. In Ghana, we use geometry every day, often without realizing it. Market traders calculate areas to determine how much produce they can display on their stalls. Farmers measure the perimeters of their fields to know how much fencing they need. Carpenters use the Pythagorean theorem to ensure their furniture has square corners. As you prepare for the BECE exam, mastering the properties of triangles and quadrilaterals will help you solve practical problems and excel in your future studies.

Imagine you are helping your uncle set up his mobile money kiosk in Kumasi. He wants to make sure the kiosk is large enough to serve customers comfortably, but not so large that it takes up too much space on the busy street. By calculating the area of the kiosk floor, you can help him find the perfect size. Or perhaps you are planning to tile the floor of your family's bathroom. By understanding the properties of rectangles and squares, you can determine how many tiles you need and create a beautiful, symmetrical pattern. Geometry is not just about abstract shapes; it is a powerful tool for solving real-world problems in Ghana and beyond.

## Main Content
### Classification of Triangles
Triangles can be classified based on the lengths of their sides or the measures of their angles:
- **Equilateral triangle**: All three sides have equal length, and all three angles measure 60°.
- **Isosceles triangle**: Two sides have equal length, and two angles have equal measure.
- **Scalene triangle**: All three sides have different lengths, and all three angles have different measures.
- **Right-angled triangle**: One angle measures 90° (a right angle).

### Classification of Quadrilaterals
Quadrilaterals can be classified based on their properties:
- **Square**: All four sides have equal length, and all four angles measure 90°.
- **Rectangle**: Opposite sides have equal length, and all four angles measure 90°.
- **Parallelogram**: Opposite sides have equal length and are parallel.
- **Rhombus**: All four sides have equal length, and opposite angles have equal measure.
- **Trapezoid**: One pair of opposite sides is parallel.

### Perimeter and Area Formulas
To calculate the perimeter and area of triangles and quadrilaterals, use the following formulas:

| Shape | Perimeter Formula | Area Formula |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| Triangle | $P = a + b + c$ | $A = \frac{1}{2}bh$ |
| Square | $P = 4s$ | $A = s^2$ |
| Rectangle | $P = 2(l + w)$ | $A = lw$ |
| Parallelogram | $P = 2(a + b)$ | $A = bh$ |
| Rhombus | $P = 4s$ | $A = \frac{1}{2}d_1d_2$ |
| Trapezoid | $P = a + b + c + d$ | $A = \frac{1}{2}(a + b)h$ |

where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the side lengths, $s$ is the length of a square's side, $l$ and $w$ are the length and width of a rectangle, $h$ is the height of a triangle or parallelogram, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the diagonals of a rhombus.

### The Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse, then:

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

This theorem is useful for solving problems involving right-angled triangles, such as finding the height of a ladder leaning against a wall or the diagonal distance across a rectangular field.

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle with length 12 cm and width 5 cm.
   
   $P = 2(l + w) = 2(12 + 5) = 2(17) = 34$ cm
   $A = lw = 12 \times 5 = 60$ cm²

2. A right-angled triangle has legs measuring 3 m and 4 m. Find the length of the hypotenuse.

   Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
   $3^2 + 4^2 = c^2$
   $9 + 16 = c^2$
   $25 = c^2$
   $c = \sqrt{25} = 5$ m

3. A farmer in the Volta Region has a triangular plot of land with a base of 20 m and a height of 15 m. She wants to fence the plot. Calculate the area of the plot and the length of fencing needed.
   
   Area of the triangle:
   $A = \frac{1}{2}bh = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \times 15 = 150$ m²
   
   To find the length of fencing needed, calculate the perimeter:
   $P = a + b + c$, where $a$ and $b$ are the other two sides, and $c$ is the base (20 m).
   
   Using the Pythagorean theorem to find $a$:
   $a^2 + 15^2 = 20^2$
   $a^2 + 225 = 400$
   $a^2 = 175$
   $a = \sqrt{175} \approx 13.23$ m
   
   Since the triangle is isosceles, $b = a \approx 13.23$ m.
   
   Perimeter:
   $P = a + b + c \approx 13.23 + 13.23 + 20 \approx 46.46$ m

1. A square has a perimeter of 48 cm. Calculate its area.
2. A parallelogram has a base of 12 m and a height of 7 m. Find its area.
3. A trapezoid has parallel sides measuring 8 cm and 14 cm, and a height of 6 cm. Calculate its area.

(Answers: 1. 144 cm²; 2. 84 m²; 3. 66 cm²)

## Summary
- Triangles can be classified as equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or right-angled based on their side lengths and angle measures.
- Quadrilaterals can be classified as squares, rectangles, parallelograms, rhombuses, or trapezoids based on their properties.
- To calculate the perimeter of a shape, add the lengths of all its sides.
- To calculate the area of a shape, use the appropriate formula based on its classification.
- The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $c$ is the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ are the legs.
