## Introduction
Algebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It has many applications in our daily lives, from calculating prices at the market to managing mobile money transactions. For example, if you buy 3 bags of rice at GH₵50 each and 2 bottles of oil at GH₵20 each, you can represent the total cost as an algebraic expression: 3x + 2y, where x is the price of a bag of rice and y is the price of a bottle of oil. By learning algebraic expressions, you'll develop problem-solving skills that will help you in your future studies and careers, especially as you prepare for the BECE and WAEC exams.

## Main Content

### Variables and Constants
In algebraic expressions, we use symbols called **variables** to represent unknown or changing values. Variables are usually represented by letters, such as x, y, or z. For example, in the expression 3x + 5, x is a variable because its value can change.

On the other hand, **constants** are values that remain fixed. In the expression 3x + 5, the numbers 3 and 5 are constants.

### Writing Algebraic Expressions
To write an algebraic expression, we combine variables, constants, and operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Here are some examples:

| Expression | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| 2x + 3 | Two times a number, plus three |
| 5y - 7 | Five times a number, minus seven |
| 4ab | Four times the product of two numbers |

### Evaluating Algebraic Expressions
To evaluate an algebraic expression, we substitute values for the variables and then simplify the result. For example, let's evaluate the expression 3x + 5 when x = 2.

Step 1: Substitute x with 2
3(2) + 5

Step 2: Simplify
6 + 5 = 11

So, when x = 2, the expression 3x + 5 evaluates to 11.

### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions
To simplify an algebraic expression, we combine like terms. **Like terms** are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers. For example, 3x and 5x are like terms, but 3x and 5y are not.

To simplify an expression, follow these steps:
1. Identify like terms
2. Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms
3. Write the result with the common variable

Example: Simplify 4x + 3y - 2x + 7y

Step 1: Identify like terms
- 4x and -2x are like terms
- 3y and 7y are like terms

Step 2: Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms
- 4x - 2x = 2x
- 3y + 7y = 10y

Step 3: Write the result with the common variable
2x + 10y

## Worked Examples

1. A farmer has a rectangular field with length 'l' meters and width 3 meters less than the length. Write an expression for the field's perimeter.

[IMAGE: Rectangle with length 'l' and width 'l-3']

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(l + w)
- Length = l
- Width = l - 3

Substitute the values into the formula:
P = 2(l + (l - 3))
P = 2(2l - 3)

Therefore, the expression for the perimeter is 2(2l - 3) or 4l - 6.

2. Kofi has 5 more pens than Ama. If Ama has 'p' pens, write an expression for the total number of pens they have together.

Let's define the variables:
- Ama's pens = p
- Kofi's pens = p + 5

To find the total number of pens, add Ama's and Kofi's pens:
Total pens = Ama's pens + Kofi's pens
Total pens = p + (p + 5)
Total pens = 2p + 5

3. Evaluate the expression 4x - 3 when x = 6.

Step 1: Substitute x with 6
4(6) - 3

Step 2: Simplify
24 - 3 = 21

So, when x = 6, the expression 4x - 3 evaluates to 21.

4. Simplify the expression 5m - 2n + 3m + 4n.

Step 1: Identify like terms
- 5m and 3m are like terms
- -2n and 4n are like terms

Step 2: Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms
- 5m + 3m = 8m
- -2n + 4n = 2n

Step 3: Write the result with the common variable
8m + 2n

## Practice Problems
1. Write an algebraic expression for the perimeter of a square with side length 's'.
2. Adwoa has 3 times as many marbles as Kwame. If Kwame has 'm' marbles, write an expression for the total number of marbles they have together.
3. Evaluate the expression 6y - 4 when y = 3.
4. Simplify the expression 2x + 7y - 3x - 2y.
