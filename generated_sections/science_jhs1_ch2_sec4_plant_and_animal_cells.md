## Introduction
Cells are the building blocks of all living things, from the tallest silk cotton tree in the Ghanaian rainforest to the smallest mosquito carrying malaria. Just as a house is built from individual bricks, living organisms are made up of cells. Understanding the structure and function of cells is crucial for Ghanaian students, as it helps them appreciate the diversity of life in their country, from the lush cocoa plantations to the vibrant marine ecosystems along the coast.

Imagine you are a farmer in Ghana, growing cocoa trees to support your family. Each cocoa pod contains seeds that will eventually be harvested and processed into delicious chocolate. But have you ever wondered what makes those cocoa trees grow and produce fruit? The answer lies in the tiny cells that make up the tree, each one working together to keep the plant alive and thriving.

## Main Content
### Plant Cell Structure
Plant cells have several distinct features that set them apart from animal cells. The most notable difference is the presence of a **cell wall**, a rigid structure that surrounds the cell membrane. The cell wall is made primarily of **cellulose**, a complex carbohydrate that provides support and protection to the cell. Other important parts of a plant cell include:

- **Chloroplasts**: Organelles responsible for photosynthesis, containing **chlorophyll**
- **Vacuoles**: Large, membrane-bound sacs that store water, nutrients, and waste products
- **Nucleus**: Contains the cell's genetic material (DNA) and controls cellular activities

### Animal Cell Structure
Animal cells share many similarities with plant cells but lack some key features. Animal cells do not have a cell wall, chloroplasts, or large vacuoles. Instead, they have the following unique structures:

- **Centrioles**: Organelles involved in cell division
- **Lysosomes**: Organelles containing digestive enzymes that break down cellular waste and foreign particles

### Comparison of Plant and Animal Cells
| Feature | Plant Cells | Animal Cells |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Cell wall | Present | Absent |
| Chloroplasts | Present | Absent |
| Large vacuoles | Present | Absent |
| Centrioles | Absent | Present |
| Lysosomes | Absent | Present |

### Photosynthesis in Plant Cells
Photosynthesis is a vital process that occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells. During photosynthesis, plants use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O) into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) and oxygen (O₂). The overall equation for photosynthesis is:

6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Practical experiment: To demonstrate the presence of starch (a type of glucose) in leaves after photosynthesis, perform the following steps:
1. Boil a leaf in water for 2-3 minutes to soften it
2. Remove the leaf and place it in a beaker containing ethanol (or methylated spirit) to remove the chlorophyll
3. Rinse the leaf with water and place it in a petri dish
4. Add a few drops of iodine solution to the leaf
5. Observe the color change: if starch is present, the leaf will turn blue-black

## Worked Examples
1. Calculate the magnification of a cell that appears 5 cm long under a microscope with an actual size of 50 μm.

Magnification = Image size / Actual size
              = 5 cm / 50 μm
              = 5 cm / 0.005 cm (converting μm to cm)
              = 1000×

2. If a plant cell has a total volume of 2000 μm³ and a vacuole that occupies 60% of the cell's volume, calculate the volume of the vacuole.

Volume of vacuole = 60% of total cell volume
                  = 0.6 × 2000 μm³
                  = 1200 μm³

## Summary
- Plant and animal cells are the basic units of life in all living organisms
- Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and large vacuoles, while animal cells have centrioles and lysosomes
- Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, converting CO₂ and H₂O into glucose and O₂ using light energy
- Cells vary in size, shape, and function depending on their role in the organism
- Understanding cell structure and function is essential for appreciating the diversity of life in Ghana and beyond
