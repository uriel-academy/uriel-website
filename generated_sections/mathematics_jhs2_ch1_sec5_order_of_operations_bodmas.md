### Introduction
Mathematics is an essential tool in our daily lives, whether we are buying goods at the market, calculating the cost of mobile money transactions, or measuring land for farming. As Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE exams, it is crucial to have a strong foundation in arithmetic and the order of operations. The BODMAS rule helps us to solve complex expressions consistently and accurately, ensuring that we arrive at the correct answer every time. By mastering this concept, you will be well-prepared for the challenges of the BECE mathematics exam and equipped to handle real-life situations involving calculations with the Ghana cedi currency and other measurements.

### Main Content
#### Understanding the BODMAS Rule
The BODMAS rule is an acronym that stands for the order in which arithmetic operations should be performed: **Brackets**, **Orders** (powers and roots), **Division**, **Multiplication**, **Addition**, and **Subtraction**. When evaluating an expression, follow the BODMAS rule to ensure the correct order of operations.

| Operation | Symbol | Order |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Brackets  | ( )    | 1st   |
| Orders    | ^, √   | 2nd   |
| Division  | ÷      | 3rd   |
| Multiplication | ×  | 4th   |
| Addition  | +      | 5th   |
| Subtraction | -    | 6th   |

#### Applying BODMAS to Simple Expressions
To apply the BODMAS rule, follow these steps:
1. Evaluate expressions within **brackets** first.
2. Calculate **orders** (powers and roots).
3. Perform **division** and **multiplication** from left to right.
4. Perform **addition** and **subtraction** from left to right.

For example, simplify the expression: 12 + (6 - 3) × 4 ÷ 2^2
1. Brackets: 12 + (3) × 4 ÷ 2^2
2. Orders: 12 + 3 × 4 ÷ 4
3. Division and Multiplication (left to right): 12 + 12 ÷ 4
4. Division and Multiplication (left to right): 12 + 3
5. Addition: 15

#### Simplifying Complex Expressions
When faced with more complex expressions, break them down into smaller parts and apply the BODMAS rule step by step.

Follow these steps to simplify complex expressions:
1. Identify the innermost brackets and simplify the expressions within them.
2. Work outwards, applying the BODMAS rule to each set of brackets.
3. Evaluate orders (powers and roots) from left to right.
4. Perform division and multiplication operations from left to right.
5. Finally, perform addition and subtraction operations from left to right.

#### Real-Life Applications
The BODMAS rule is essential for solving real-life problems involving multiple arithmetic operations. For example:
- Calculating the total cost of goods bought at the market.
- Determining the profit or loss from a business transaction.
- Converting between different units of measurement.

### Worked Examples
1. Simplify: 24 ÷ 3 + 2 × (5 - 3)^2
   1. Brackets: 24 ÷ 3 + 2 × 2^2
   2. Orders: 24 ÷ 3 + 2 × 4
   3. Division and Multiplication (left to right): 8 + 8
   4. Addition: 16

2. Kofi bought 3 bags of rice at GH₵45 each and 2 boxes of oil at GH₵80 each. He received a discount of GH₵20. Calculate the total amount Kofi paid.
   * Total cost of rice = 3 × GH₵45 = GH₵135
   * Total cost of oil = 2 × GH₵80 = GH₵160
   * Total cost before discount = GH₵135 + GH₵160 = GH₵295
   * Total amount paid = GH₵295 - GH₵20 = GH₵275
   
   Therefore, Kofi paid a total of GH₵275.

3. A rectangular farm has a length of 120 m and a width of 60 m. A fence is to be built around the farm, with a gate that is 3 m wide. Calculate the length of the fence needed, excluding the gate.
   * Perimeter of the farm = 2 × (length + width)
   * Perimeter = 2 × (120 m + 60 m) = 2 × 180 m = 360 m
   * Length of fence needed = Perimeter - Width of gate
   * Length of fence = 360 m - 3 m = 357 m

   Therefore, the length of the fence needed is 357 m.

### Practice Problems
1. Evaluate: 18 - 4 × 3 + (12 - 6) ÷ 2
2. Ama has GH₵750. She spends 2/5 of the money on a new phone and 1/3 of the remaining money on books. How much money does Ama have left?
3. A square room has a side length of 5 m. Calculate the area of the floor if a rectangular carpet with dimensions 2 m by 3 m is placed in the center of the room.

Answers:
1. 12
2. GH₵300
3. 19 m²
