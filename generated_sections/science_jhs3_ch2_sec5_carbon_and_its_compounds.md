2. Explain how carbon compounds are formed
3. Differentiate between organic and inorganic compounds
4. List examples of organic compounds and their uses in everyday life
5. Write chemical formulas for simple organic compounds

## Introduction
Carbon is a fascinating element that plays a crucial role in our lives here in Ghana. From the cocoa beans that our farmers grow to the hydroelectric power generated at the Akosombo Dam, carbon compounds are everywhere. Even our own bodies are made up of carbon-based organic compounds! In this lesson, we will explore the properties of carbon, how it forms compounds, and the importance of organic compounds in our daily lives.

Ghana is rich in natural resources, many of which contain carbon compounds. The lush tropical forests are home to a diverse array of plant life, all of which are composed of organic compounds. Understanding the role of carbon in these ecosystems is essential for protecting and preserving our environment for future generations.

## Main Content
### Properties of Carbon
Carbon is a unique element with the following properties:
- It has an atomic number of 6 and is represented by the symbol C
- It can form four covalent bonds, allowing it to create a wide variety of compounds
- It exists in several forms, including diamond, graphite, and fullerenes
- It is the fourth most abundant element in the universe

### Formation of Carbon Compounds
Carbon atoms can bond with other elements to form compounds in two main ways:
1. Covalent bonding: Carbon shares electrons with other atoms to form stable compounds
2. Coordinate (dative) covalent bonding: Carbon accepts a lone pair of electrons from another atom

The versatility of carbon bonding allows for the formation of millions of different compounds, both organic and inorganic.

### Organic vs. Inorganic Compounds
Carbon compounds can be classified into two main categories:

| Organic Compounds | Inorganic Compounds |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Contain carbon-hydrogen bonds | Do not contain carbon-hydrogen bonds |
| Found in living organisms | Found in non-living things |
| Examples: carbohydrates, proteins, fats | Examples: carbon dioxide, carbonate minerals |

### Examples of Organic Compounds
Organic compounds are essential for life and have numerous applications in our daily lives. Some examples include:

1. Carbohydrates (C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>O<sub>z</sub>)
   - Sugars (e.g., glucose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>)
   - Starch (found in cassava, yams, and plantains)
   - Cellulose (main component of plant cell walls)

2. Proteins (C, H, O, N, and sometimes S)
   - Enzymes (catalyze biochemical reactions)
   - Structural proteins (e.g., collagen)
   - Transport proteins (e.g., hemoglobin)

3. Fats and Oils (C, H, and O)
   - Energy storage
   - Insulation and protection
   - Examples: palm oil, shea butter

### Practical Example: Extracting Oils from Plants
You can extract oils from various plants using simple materials found at home:
1. Collect plant material (e.g., palm fruit, coconut, shea nuts)
2. Grind or crush the plant material
3. Boil the crushed material in water for 30 minutes
4. Allow the mixture to cool and skim off the oil that rises to the surface
5. Filter the oil through a clean cloth to remove any impurities

## Worked Examples
1. Write the chemical formula for glucose, a simple sugar:
   - Glucose has 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms
   - Formula: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>

2. Calculate the number of covalent bonds a carbon atom can form:
   - Carbon has 4 valence electrons
   - Each covalent bond involves sharing 1 electron with another atom
   - Number of covalent bonds = 4 valence electrons ÷ 1 electron per bond = 4 bonds

## Summary
- Carbon is a unique element that can form four covalent bonds
- Carbon compounds can be organic (containing C-H bonds) or inorganic
- Organic compounds include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats
- Organic compounds are essential for life and have many applications
- Oils can be extracted from plants using simple materials and methods
