Some common advanced kitchen tools you may find in Ghanaian homes and businesses include:

1. **Blender**: Used to purée fruits, vegetables, and other foods into smooth drinks (like smoothies) or sauces. Common for making nkontomire stew or peanut butter soup.

2. **Pressure Cooker**: A sealed pot that cooks food quickly using steam pressure. Cooks tough foods like beans, meat, and rice faster than standard pots. Used for jollof rice, waakye, and more.

3. **Food Processor**: Chops, slices, grates, and mixes ingredients. Can quickly prepare large amounts of food. Used to grind pepper, tomatoes, and onions for stews and soups.

4. **Stand Mixer**: Combines baking ingredients like flour, sugar, and eggs. Kneads dough for bread and pastries. Important for bakers and pastry chefs.

5. **Electric Kettle**: Boils water faster than a stovetop. Makes tea, coffee, and instant hot foods. Found in many homes and offices.

### Using Kitchen Knives Safely

Kitchen knives are essential tools but can be dangerous if used improperly. Follow these safety guidelines:

- Always keep knives sharp. Dull knives slip more easily and cause accidents.
- Hold the knife by the handle with your dominant hand. Never touch the blade.
- Use your other hand to hold the food, curling your fingertips under to avoid cuts. 
- Cut on a stable cutting board, not in your hand.
- Slice using a back-and-forth motion, not straight down. Let the sharpness of the blade do the work.
- Store knives in a block or sheath, not loose in a drawer.

Knife Safety Rules

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Keep knives sharp | Use dull knives |
| Hold knife by handle | Touch the blade |
| Curl fingers on food | Cut in your hand | 
| Cut on cutting board | Leave knives loose |
| Slice, don't chop | Cut too fast |
