## Section: Approximation and Estimation

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept of rounding numbers to a specified place value
- Estimate sums, differences, products, and quotients using rounded numbers
- Apply approximation and estimation strategies to real-world problems
- Determine the reasonableness of answers using estimation

## Introduction
In our daily lives, we often encounter situations where exact calculations are not necessary or practical. Imagine you're at the market in Accra, and you want to quickly estimate the total cost of your groceries before reaching the cashier. Or perhaps you're a farmer in the Volta Region, and you need to approximate the yield of your maize harvest. In such cases, the mathematical skills of approximation and estimation become invaluable.

Approximation and estimation are also crucial in preparing for the BECE (Basic Education Certificate Examination) in Ghana. These techniques allow you to check the reasonableness of your answers and solve problems more efficiently. By mastering these skills, you'll be well-equipped to tackle various mathematical challenges, both in academics and in real-life situations.

## Main Content
### Rounding Numbers
Rounding is the process of replacing a number with a simplified value that is close to the original number. The basic rules for rounding are:

1. Identify the place value to which you want to round (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands).
2. Look at the digit to the right of the identified place value.
3. If the digit is 5 or greater, round up by adding 1 to the digit in the identified place value. If the digit is less than 5, keep the digit in the identified place value unchanged.
4. Replace all digits to the right of the identified place value with zeros.

For example, let's round 3,482 to the nearest hundred:
1. The hundreds place is the second digit from the right.
2. The digit to the right of the hundreds place is 8, which is greater than 5.
3. Round up by adding 1 to the digit in the hundreds place: 3,500.
4. Replace all digits to the right of the hundreds place with zeros: 3,500.

### Estimating Sums and Differences
To estimate the sum or difference of two or more numbers:
1. Round each number to a place value that makes the calculation easier (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands).
2. Perform the operation (addition or subtraction) using the rounded numbers.

Example:
Estimate the sum of 4,821 and 5,196.
1. Round each number to the nearest thousand:
   4,821 rounds to 5,000
   5,196 rounds to 5,000
2. Add the rounded numbers: 5,000 + 5,000 = 10,000

Therefore, the estimated sum of 4,821 and 5,196 is 10,000.

### Estimating Products and Quotients
To estimate the product or quotient of two numbers:
1. Round each number to a place value that makes the calculation easier (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands).
2. Perform the operation (multiplication or division) using the rounded numbers.

Example:
Estimate the product of 312 and 24.
1. Round each number to the nearest hundred and ten, respectively:
   312 rounds to 300
   24 rounds to 20
2. Multiply the rounded numbers: 300 × 20 = 6,000

Therefore, the estimated product of 312 and 24 is 6,000.

### Checking the Reasonableness of Answers
After solving a problem, use estimation to check if your answer makes sense. If the estimated value is close to your calculated answer, it's likely that your answer is reasonable.

Example:
Calculate: 2,931 + 4,157
Answer: 7,088

To check the reasonableness of the answer, estimate the sum by rounding each number to the nearest thousand:
3,000 + 4,000 = 7,000

The estimated sum (7,000) is close to the calculated answer (7,088), so the answer is reasonable.

## Worked Examples
1. Kofi wants to buy a bag of rice for GH₵ 45.50 and a container of cooking oil for GH₵ 19.75. Estimate the total cost of his purchase.
   - Round each price to the nearest cedi:
     GH₵ 45.50 rounds to GH₵ 46
     GH₵ 19.75 rounds to GH₵ 20
   - Add the rounded prices: GH₵ 46 + GH₵ 20 = GH₵ 66
   Therefore, the estimated total cost is GH₵ 66.

2. [IMAGE: A rectangular field with dimensions 128 meters by 42 meters]
   Estimate the area of the field in square meters.
   - Round each dimension to the nearest ten:
     128 rounds to 130
     42 rounds to 40
   - Multiply the rounded dimensions: 130 × 40 = 5,200
   Therefore, the estimated area of the field is 5,200 square meters.

3. Adwoa scored 4,218 points in a mobile money quiz competition. Kwame scored 3,895 points. Estimate the difference between their scores.
   - Round each score to the nearest hundred:
     4,218 rounds to 4,200
     3,895 rounds to 3,900
   - Subtract the rounded scores: 4,200 - 3,900 = 300
   Therefore, the estimated difference between their scores is 300 points.

## Practice Problems
1. Estimate the sum of 2,413 and 1,789.
2. A store sold 612 pairs of shoes in a month. Estimate the number of shoes sold.
3. A farmer harvested 3,891 kilograms of cocoa beans. Estimate the harvest to the nearest ton (1 ton = 1,000 kg).
4. The product of two numbers is approximately 1,200. If one of the numbers is 48, estimate the other number.

Answers:
1. 4,000
2. 1,200 shoes
3. 4 tons
4. 30
