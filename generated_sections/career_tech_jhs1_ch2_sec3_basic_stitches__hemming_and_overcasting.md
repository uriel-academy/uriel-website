### Hemming Stitch
Hemming is a technique used to finish the raw edges of fabric and prevent fraying. Here's how to sew a basic hem:

1. Measure and mark the desired hem allowance on the fabric.
2. Fold the fabric edge up to the marked line and press with an iron.
3. Fold the hem allowance under itself and press again to create a neat edge.
4. Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of the thread.
5. Start sewing from the inside of the garment, inserting the needle through the folded hem allowance and the garment fabric.
6. Create small, evenly spaced stitches along the hem, keeping the stitches close to the folded edge.
7. Secure the end of the stitching with a few backstitches and trim the excess thread.

### Overcasting Stitch
Overcasting is a stitch used to finish raw fabric edges and prevent them from unraveling. Follow these steps to sew an overcast stitch:

1. Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of the thread.
2. Start sewing from the right side of the fabric, inserting the needle through the edge of the fabric.
3. Bring the needle back up and over the edge, making a diagonal stitch.
4. Continue sewing diagonal stitches over the fabric edge, keeping the stitches evenly spaced and consistent in size.
5. Secure the end of the stitching with a few backstitches and trim the excess thread.

### Safety Precautions
When working with sharp sewing tools, it's crucial to follow safety precautions to prevent injuries:

- Keep scissors and needles away from your face and body while working.
- Store sharp tools in a safe place when not in use, out of reach of young children.
- Use a thimble to protect your fingers when pushing the needle through thick fabric.
- Avoid distractions while sewing to prevent accidental pricks or cuts.
