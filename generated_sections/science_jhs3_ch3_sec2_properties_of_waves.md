## Introduction
Waves are all around us in Ghana, from the ripples on Lake Volta to the sound of drums at a traditional festival. Even the light from the sun that helps cocoa trees grow reaches us in the form of waves. Understanding the properties of waves is essential for many aspects of our lives, such as communication through radio and mobile phones, generating electricity at the Akosombo Dam, and even diagnosing diseases using medical imaging. In this section, we will explore the fascinating world of waves and learn about their characteristics and behavior.

Imagine throwing a stone into the calm waters of the Gulf of Guinea. You'll observe the water surface rippling outwards from the point of impact. These ripples are an example of waves, which are disturbances that carry energy from one point to another without transferring matter. Waves play a crucial role in various fields, including physics, engineering, and medicine. By understanding the properties of waves, we can harness their power to improve our lives and solve problems in our society.

## Main Content
### What are Waves?
Waves are disturbances that propagate through a medium, transferring energy without transporting matter. They are characterized by their ability to travel through space and time, and they can be classified into two main types: **transverse waves** and **longitudinal waves**.

In transverse waves, the direction of the disturbance is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. A common example of a transverse wave is a wave on a string, such as the vibrations of a guitar string. When you pluck the string, it oscillates up and down, creating a wave that travels along the length of the string.

Longitudinal waves, on the other hand, have a disturbance parallel to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves are an example of longitudinal waves. When you speak, your vocal cords vibrate, creating compressions and rarefactions in the air. These disturbances travel through the air as sound waves, allowing others to hear your voice.

### Characteristics of Waves
Waves have several key characteristics that describe their behavior and properties:

1. **Amplitude (A)**: The maximum displacement of a wave from its equilibrium position. It determines the intensity or loudness of a wave.

2. **Wavelength (λ)**: The distance between two consecutive crests or troughs of a wave. It is usually measured in meters (m).

3. **Frequency (f)**: The number of wave cycles that pass a fixed point in one second. It is measured in hertz (Hz). Higher frequency waves have more energy than lower frequency waves.

4. **Period (T)**: The time taken for one complete wave cycle. It is the reciprocal of frequency and is measured in seconds (s).

5. **Wave speed (v)**: The speed at which a wave propagates through a medium. It depends on the properties of the medium and is measured in meters per second (m/s).

These characteristics are related by the wave equation:

v = fλ

This equation shows that wave speed is directly proportional to both frequency and wavelength.

### Types of Waves
Waves can be further classified based on their medium of propagation and energy transfer:

| Wave Type | Medium | Energy Transfer | Examples |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| Mechanical waves | Requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) | Energy is transferred through the oscillation of particles in the medium | Water waves, sound waves, seismic waves |
| Electromagnetic waves | Can travel through a vacuum (no medium required) | Energy is transferred through oscillating electric and magnetic fields | Light, radio waves, X-rays, gamma rays |

### Practical Experiment: Investigating Wave Properties
To better understand wave properties, let's conduct a simple experiment using a slinky spring:

Materials:
- Slinky spring
- Stopwatch
- Meter ruler

Procedure:
1. Stretch the slinky spring on a flat surface, such as a table or the floor.
2. Have one person hold each end of the slinky spring.
3. Create a transverse wave by quickly moving one end of the slinky up and down.
4. Observe the wave as it travels along the slinky.
5. Measure the wavelength by finding the distance between two consecutive crests or troughs.
6. Count the number of complete wave cycles that pass a fixed point in 10 seconds. Divide this number by 10 to find the frequency.
7. Calculate the wave speed using the wave equation: v = fλ.

Repeat the experiment with different frequencies and amplitudes, and compare the results.

## Worked Examples
1. A wave has a wavelength of 2 meters and a frequency of 5 Hz. Calculate the wave speed.

Solution:
Using the wave equation: v = fλ
v = 5 Hz × 2 m
v = 10 m/s

Therefore, the wave speed is 10 meters per second.

2. A sound wave traveling through air has a frequency of 440 Hz and a speed of 343 m/s. Calculate the wavelength of the sound wave.

Solution:
Rearranging the wave equation: λ = v/f
λ = 343 m/s ÷ 440 Hz
λ = 0.78 m

The wavelength of the sound wave is approximately 0.78 meters.

## Summary
- Waves are disturbances that transfer energy through a medium without transferring matter.
- Transverse waves have a disturbance perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation, while longitudinal waves have a disturbance parallel to the direction of wave propagation.
- Key characteristics of waves include amplitude, wavelength, frequency, period, and wave speed.
- The wave equation (v = fλ) relates wave speed, frequency, and wavelength.
- Waves can be classified as mechanical or electromagnetic based on their medium of propagation and energy transfer.
- Practical experiments, such as using a slinky spring, can help investigate and understand wave properties.
