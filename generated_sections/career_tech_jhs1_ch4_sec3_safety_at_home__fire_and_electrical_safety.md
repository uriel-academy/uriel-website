- Unattended cooking fires or candles
- Faulty wiring or appliances

### Proper Use and Maintenance of Electrical Appliances
To prevent electrical fires, follow these guidelines when using appliances:
1. Inspect cords regularly for damage. Replace frayed or exposed wires immediately.
2. Don't overload outlets. Avoid plugging too many appliances into one socket.
3. Unplug appliances when not in use and store them safely.

Every home should have a fire evacuation plan. Follow these steps to create yours:
1. Draw a floor plan of your home, marking two exits from each room.
2. Identify a safe meeting place outside, like a neighbor's house or a nearby landmark.
3. Practice evacuation drills twice a year with your family.
4. Keep exits clear of furniture and clutter.

### Fire Extinguisher Basics

- **S**weep the nozzle from side to side

Types of Fire Extinguishers:
| Class | Suitable For | Not Suitable For |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| A     | Wood, paper, cloth, trash | Flammable liquids or electrical fires |
| B     | Oil, petrol, kerosene | Wood or electrical fires |
| C     | Electrical equipment | Wood or flammable liquids |
