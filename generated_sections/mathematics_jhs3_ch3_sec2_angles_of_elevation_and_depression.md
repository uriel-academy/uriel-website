## Introduction
Trigonometry is a crucial branch of mathematics that has numerous applications in everyday life, especially in Ghana. For example, when you visit the Makola Market in Accra and look up at the tall buildings surrounding the market, you are observing angles of elevation. Similarly, when you stand on top of the iconic Independence Arch and look down at the people below, you are experiencing angles of depression. Understanding these concepts is essential for success in the BECE mathematics exam and for practical problem-solving skills in fields such as construction, engineering, and agriculture.

Imagine you are a farmer in the Volta Region, and you need to calculate the height of a tree to determine if it is suitable for timber. By using the principles of angles of elevation and trigonometric ratios, you can easily find the tree's height without physically measuring it. These mathematical skills are not only useful for your future career but also for making informed decisions in your daily life, such as estimating the height of a building or the distance across a river.

## Main Content
### Defining Angles of Elevation and Depression
An **angle of elevation** is the angle formed between a horizontal line and the line of sight when looking up at an object. For example, when you look up at the top of a flagpole from the ground, the angle between the ground and your line of sight is an angle of elevation.

An **angle of depression** is the angle formed between a horizontal line and the line of sight when looking down at an object. For example, when you look down at a boat from the top of a cliff, the angle between the cliff's edge and your line of sight is an angle of depression.

### Trigonometric Ratios
To solve problems involving angles of elevation and depression, we use trigonometric ratios: **sine**, **cosine**, and **tangent**. These ratios are based on the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.

Given a right-angled triangle with angle θ, the trigonometric ratios are:

| Ratio  | Formula          |
|--------|------------------|
| sin(θ) | opposite / hypotenuse |
| cos(θ) | adjacent / hypotenuse |
| tan(θ) | opposite / adjacent   |

### Solving Problems with Angles of Elevation and Depression
To solve problems involving angles of elevation and depression, follow these steps:
1. Draw a diagram to represent the problem, clearly labeling the angle of elevation or depression and the known distances.
2. Identify the right-angled triangle formed in the diagram.
3. Determine which trigonometric ratio (sine, cosine, or tangent) to use based on the known and unknown sides of the triangle.
4. Write an equation using the appropriate trigonometric ratio and the known values.
5. Solve the equation to find the unknown distance or height.

### Applications and Examples
Angles of elevation and depression have numerous applications in real-world scenarios, such as:
- Calculating the height of buildings, trees, or mountains
- Determining the distance between two points separated by a river or valley
- Estimating the depth of a well or the height of a bridge
- Solving problems related to ramps, slopes, and inclined planes

## Worked Examples
1. Kofi stands 50 meters away from the base of a telecommunications tower. The angle of elevation from Kofi's position to the top of the tower is 60°. Calculate the height of the tower.

[IMAGE: Diagram showing Kofi, the tower, the angle of elevation, and the distance from Kofi to the base of the tower]

Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio to use. In this case, we use the tangent ratio because we know the angle and the adjacent side (distance from Kofi to the base of the tower).

Step 2: Write an equation using the tangent ratio.
tan(60°) = height / 50

Step 3: Solve the equation for the height.
height = 50 × tan(60°)
height ≈ 86.6 meters

Therefore, the height of the telecommunications tower is approximately 86.6 meters.

2. Adwoa is flying a kite on a beach in Cape Coast. The string of the kite makes an angle of elevation of 35° with the ground. If the length of the string is 80 meters, find the height of the kite above the ground.

[IMAGE: Diagram showing Adwoa, the kite, the angle of elevation, and the length of the string]

Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio to use. We will use the sine ratio because we know the angle and the hypotenuse (length of the string).

Step 2: Write an equation using the sine ratio.
sin(35°) = height / 80

Step 3: Solve the equation for the height.
height = 80 × sin(35°)
height ≈ 45.9 meters

Therefore, the height of the kite above the ground is approximately 45.9 meters.

3. From the top of a hill, the angle of depression to a village in the valley below is 25°. If the distance between the hill and the village is 3 km, calculate the height of the hill.

[IMAGE: Diagram showing the hill, the village, the angle of depression, and the distance between the hill and the village]

Step 1: Identify the trigonometric ratio to use. We will use the tangent ratio because we know the angle and the adjacent side (distance between the hill and the village).

Step 2: Write an equation using the tangent ratio.
tan(25°) = height / 3

Step 3: Solve the equation for the height.
height = 3 × tan(25°)
height ≈ 1.4 km

Therefore, the height of the hill is approximately 1.4 km or 1,400 meters.

## Practice Problems
1. A ladder leans against a wall, making an angle of 72° with the ground. If the foot of the ladder is 1.5 meters away from the base of the wall, find the length of the ladder. (Round your answer to one decimal place.)

2. From a point on the ground, the angle of elevation to the top of a building is 55°. If the point is 20 meters away from the base of the building, calculate the height of the building. (Round your answer to one decimal place.)

3. An observer on top of a lighthouse sees a boat at an angle of depression of 30°. If the lighthouse is 50 meters tall, find the distance between the boat and the base of the lighthouse. (Round your answer to one decimal place.)

1. 5.0 meters
2. 27.3 meters
3. 86.6 meters
