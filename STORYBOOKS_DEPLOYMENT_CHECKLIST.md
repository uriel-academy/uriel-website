- [x] All books have valid titles and authors
- [x] Flutter app compiles without errors
- [x] Books tab displays storybooks
- [x] Search and filter work

### Nice to Have (Future Enhancements)

## üìù Known Limitations

1. **No EPUB Reader**: Books display metadata only, reading feature not implemented
2. **No Book Covers**: Using generic icon placeholders
3. **Client-Side Search**: All books loaded, filtering done locally
4. **Asset Size**: 382MB added to app bundle (consider CDN for production scale)
5. **No Pagination**: All 96 books load at once (acceptable for current size)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If books don't display:
1. Check Firestore indexes are built (can take 5-10 minutes)
2. Verify `assets/storybooks/` exists in pubspec.yaml
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Firestore rules allow read access

### If search doesn't work:
1. Check `_applyStoryFilter()` is called on text change
2. Verify `searchQuery` state is updating
3. Check `filteredStorybooks` list is being used in UI

### If images don't load:
1. Verify EPUB files are in `assets/storybooks/` folder
2. Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
3. Rebuild app
