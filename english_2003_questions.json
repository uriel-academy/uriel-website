      "content": "The children rushed out of school that afternoon singing the song they had just learned:Rain, rain, go away.Go and come another day.Little children want to play.Rain, rain, go away.But they stopped abruptly when they looked up and saw dark clouds racing across the sky. These were signs of rain and the children were beside themselves with joy. Then they burst into yet another song.The rains will soon come.The sky will be bright.And the guns will boom.As they sang and danced, they were soon joined by their parents in their happiness. It was six months since it had last rained and all that time the farmers prayed for rain that would not come. The result was famine in the country for the land became so dry that new crops could not be sown and cassava could not be uprooted. The streams and the wells had also dried up and the people could find very little water for themselves and their livestock. Was it then strange that adults danced and sang like children in the hope that their troubles would soon be over? They were sure that the fetish priest's sacrifices would not be in vain. But they woke up the next morning to find that the land was still dry; there was not a drop of rain water anywhere.Then they became very angry and ran after the fetish priest. But he was gone before they could lynch him.",

      "content": "Teacher Amu never lost the opportunity to give pep-talks to his students. Variety is the spice of life, he often began. Then he would tell them how life has opposites, like good and bad. He would talk about the variety of birds, the different kinds of fish and species of trees. His students could always tell when teacher Amu's sermons were about to end. He would raise his voice and look up as he make his point: \"God made them all and He said. 'It is good'.\"These words had a lasting effect on his students. When the class was over, they would go on reeling with laughter as they recited these words. Soon, it was not surprising when they began to call Teacher Amu. 'God made them all' whenever his back was turned.But one of them, Kofi Abre, did not consider Teacher Amu's pep-talk funny at all. He was not amused that his classmates joked with his teacher's words. Teacher Amu has said that the world was made up of different things, different people and different habits. So why did they bother when he, Abre, acted differently?The other day, he shouted down a school mate who called him lazy. He almost bloodied a friend's nose too when his friend scolded him for not doing his homework. Teacher Amu warned that he would punish Abre. It was an act of indiscipline. Kofi Abre shook his head. It was his friend who offended him yet teacher Amu would punish him for being violent and different.",
