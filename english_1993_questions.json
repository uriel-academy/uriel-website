      "content": "Bako was both intelligent and hardworking so he soon learnt all that Garba taught him of the art of reading and writing. Now he was able to earn a little extra income as a letter-writer and reader to his fellow illiterate labourers. All the people trusted him because he never revealed any information he got from the letters to anyone.Bako's happiest moments came on Saturdays when he received his pay and on Mondays when the labourers returned to work bringing with them all the gossip and laughter of their villages. Unfortunately, a misfortune befell Bako. One day, as he stood gazing proudly at a big tree, which he had just felled, another tree being cut down by a fellow labourer struck him on the head. The branches tore his face and he fell unconscious. His friends carried him to Adom Hospital.The accident changed Bako's life. His handsome face became permanently scarred. He lost his strength and job. At first, he hoped that in time he would regain his strength but Bako grew weaker and weaker.",

      "content": "We can have close friends for a very long time. But when friendship and duty come into conflict, as I once experienced, many problems may occur.Almost all my friends and I are leading members of our school's Supporters Club. In the beginning of our final year it was time to elect new officers for the club. Everyone stood the chance of being elected.When I was elected as President, I knew it would be a tough job because I would be in charge of my closest friends. The real test would come when the sports season started.Just as I had imagined, there were many disputes. No one listened to what I said. Everyone just wanted to have fun instead of cheering our athletes. I knew I had to motivate them and use discipline and that was exactly what I did.Many of my friends could not understand this. While some of them stopped coming to the games others were not talking to me at all.I finally decided to have a talk with everyone. I frankly admitted that I did not like the job but since I had it, I was determined to do my best. I also told them to leave sports matters on the field because my friends were more important to me than the job. From that little talk, I had everything resolved.",
