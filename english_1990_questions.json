      "content": "t was an English lesson and our classroom was quiet. The blackboard was covered with sentences on 'if' clauses and we went through such different forms as:1. If he comes, I shall be happy;2. If you abused him, he would beat you;3. Amo could have won the race if he had trained harderWe all found it difficult to understand the formula for each sentence. We had problems with the tenses but as our final examinations were so near we really had to master them. We were, however, interrupted by the noise of a bucket and heavy footsteps on the veranda. Then Mr. Odumba's big head came round the door.Sorry to interrupt, he told our teacher. We all looked up, highly pleased at the welcomed interruption. Who knows, Mr. Odumba might fall down again and what could be more pleasing than that in the middle of a difficult lesson?\"Can I have a word with you alone, please?\" Mr. Odumba asked our teacher who followed him to the veranda. Mr. Odumba, looking uncomfortable, took a deep breath and said that some pawpaw he had marked in the morning had been stolen from his garden.Finally, he asked our teacher, \"would you mind if I went round to find out which of your pupils\" hands smell of pawpaw?",

      "content": "Have you ever watched two dogs fighting? The scene is both interesting and terrifying. I once watched two dogs, Whisky and Sandy fighting. Whisky was a brown dog with white hair round his eyes. This made him look very fearful. He was often running after lizards and barking at strange things and visitors. Sandy, on the other hand, was a black dog with white legs and face. He was gentle and friendly to both adults and children.When the fight started, everybody thought Sandy would be no match for Whisky. Whisky was the first to attack. He jumped up with his fore-legs raised, mouth wide open and gripped the back of Sandy's neck with his sharp teeth. Sandy went down with Whisky on top of him. Sandy played it cool as if he did not feel any pain. The spectators believed the more aggressive Whisky had won the fight.Suddenly, the tide turned. Sandy got hold of one of Whisky's hind legs and bit hard as if breaking a bone. Whisky felt the pain and as he opened his mouth to yelp, Sandy broke free.As Whisky was about to attack again Sandy jumped on his back and held his throat. Down he went on his back. The crowd then cheered, Sandy! San-dy!! San-dy!!!Feeling very proud, Sandy released Whisky and he ran away with his tail between his legs. Sandy had won the fight.",
