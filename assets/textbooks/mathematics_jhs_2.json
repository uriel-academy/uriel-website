Understand the concept of integers and directed numbers\r\n2. Add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers\r\n3. Apply integer operations to solve real-world problems\r\n4. Represent integers on a number line\r\n5. Understand the absolute value of an integer\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we often encounter situations that involve positive and negative numbers. For example, when trading at Makola Market in Accra, a vendor might make a profit of GH₵50 on a good day, but lose GH₵20 on a slow day. These positive and negative values can be represented using integers. Understanding integers is crucial for managing personal finances, such as keeping track of your mobile money balance or calculating your net profit from selling farm produce. Additionally, mastering integer operations will help you excel in the Mathematics section of the BECE exam, which is essential for progressing to senior high school.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### 1. Definition of Integers and Directed Numbers\r\n**Integers** are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. They are represented by the symbol ℤ. Examples of integers include -5, -2, 0, 3, and 7. **Directed numbers** are integers that have a specific direction or sign, either positive (+) or negative (-).\r\n\r\n### 2. Addition and Subtraction of Integers\r\nWhen adding integers with the same sign, keep the sign and add the absolute values. When adding integers with different signs, subtract the absolute values and keep the sign of the integer with the larger absolute value.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- (+5) + (+3) = +8\r\n- (-7) + (-2) = -9\r\n- (+6) + (-4) = +2\r\n- (-3) + (+8) = +5\r\n\r\nTo subtract integers, add the opposite (additive inverse) of the integer being subtracted.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- (+7) - (+4) = (+7) + (-4) = +3\r\n- (-5) - (-8) = (-5) + (+8) = +3\r\n- (+6) - (-3) = (+6) + (+3) = +9\r\n\r\n### 3. Multiplication and Division of Integers\r\nWhen multiplying or dividing integers, follow these rules:\r\n- The product or quotient of two integers with the same sign is positive.\r\n- The product or quotient of two integers with different signs is negative.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- (+5) × (+3) = +15\r\n- (-4) × (-6) = +24\r\n- (+7) × (-2) = -14\r\n- (-8) ÷ (+2) = -4\r\n- (+15) ÷ (-3) = -5\r\n\r\n### 4. Number Line Representation and Absolute Value\r\nIntegers can be represented on a number line, with positive integers to the right of zero and negative integers to the left of zero.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A number line with integers from -5 to +5 labeled and evenly spaced]\r\n\r\nThe **absolute value** of an integer is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of its sign. It is denoted by two vertical bars surrounding the integer. For example, |+4| = 4 and |-4| = 4.\r\n\r\n| Property                     | Example         |\r\n|------------------------------|-----------------|\r\n| Definition                   | \\|a\\| = a if a ≥ 0, \\|a\\| = -a if a < 0 |\r\n| Non-negativity               | \\|a\\| ≥ 0        |\r\n| Distance from zero           | \\|a\\| = \\|-a\\|     |\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. A farmer in Kumasi sold 25 bags of maize for GH₵120 each and 18 bags of rice for GH₵150 each. However, 7 bags of maize were spoiled and had to be discarded, resulting in a loss of GH₵80 per bag. What was the farmer's net profit?\r\n\r\nProfit from maize: 25 × GH₵120 = GH₵3,000\r\nProfit from rice: 18 × GH₵150 = GH₵2,700\r\nLoss from spoiled maize: 7 × GH₵80 = GH₵560\r\n\r\nNet profit = Profit from maize + Profit from rice - Loss from spoiled maize\r\nNet profit = GH₵3,000 + GH₵2,700 - GH₵560\r\nNet profit = GH₵5,140\r\n\r\n2. Kofi and Ama are playing a game where they earn points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect answers. Kofi earned 12 points, then lost 5 points, earned 7 points, and lost 3 points. Ama lost 4 points, earned 9 points, lost 6 points, and earned 8 points. Who has more points at the end of the game?\r\n\r\nKofi's points: (+12) + (-5) + (+7) + (-3) = +11 points\r\nAma's points: (-4) + (+9) + (-6) + (+8) = +7 points\r\n\r\nSince +11 > +7, Kofi has more points at the end of the game.\r\n\r\n3. Adwoa and Kwame are comparing the altitudes of two cities in Ghana. Kumasi has an altitude of 250 meters above sea level, while Tarkwa has an altitude of 78 meters below sea level. What is the difference in altitude between the two cities?\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A vertical number line with Kumasi at +250 m and Tarkwa at -78 m]\r\n\r\nDifference in altitude = |Altitude of Kumasi - Altitude of Tarkwa|\r\nDifference in altitude = |(+250) - (-78)|\r\nDifference in altitude = |(+250) + (+78)|\r\nDifference in altitude = |+328|\r\nDifference in altitude = 328 meters\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. Evaluate: (-8) + (+5) - (-12) + (-3)\r\n2. The temperature in Tamale was 4°C at 6 am. By noon, it had risen by 7°C, and by 6 pm, it had dropped by 5°C. What was the temperature at 6 pm?\r\n3. Calculate: (-15) × (+4) ÷ (-3)\r\n\r\nAnswers:\r\n1. +6\r\n2. 6°C\r\n3. +20\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero.\r\n- When adding integers, keep the sign if both integers have the same sign; otherwise, subtract the absolute values and keep the sign of the integer with the larger absolute value.\r\n- To subtract integers, add the additive inverse of the integer being subtracted.\r\n- The product or quotient of two integers with the same sign is positive, while the product or quotient of two integers with different signs is negative.\r\n- The absolute value of an integer is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of its sign.\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n| Term/Formula                 | Meaning/Use                              |\r\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n| Integer (ℤ)                  | Whole numbers (positive, negative, zero) |\r\n| Directed numbers             | Integers with a specific sign (+ or -)   |\r\n| Absolute value (\\|a\\|)         | Distance of an integer from zero         |\r\n| Additive inverse             | The opposite of an integer (a + (-a) = 0)|\r\n| Product                      | The result of multiplication             |\r\n| Quotient                     | The result of division                   |",

Understand the concept of powers and roots\r\n2. Apply the laws of indices to simplify expressions\r\n3. Evaluate powers and roots of real numbers\r\n4. Solve problems involving powers and roots in real-life situations\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our everyday lives, we often encounter situations that involve repeated multiplication or division. For example, when you visit the market in Accra to buy groceries, you might need to calculate the cost of buying multiple items of the same price. If you're saving money in your mobile money account, you might want to know how much you'll have after a certain period of consistent saving. Powers and roots help us simplify these calculations and solve problems more efficiently.\r\n\r\nMoreover, understanding powers and roots is crucial for your success in the BECE mathematics exam. Mastering these concepts will not only help you solve complex problems quickly but also lay a strong foundation for your future studies in mathematics and science.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Powers and Exponents\r\nA power is a way of expressing repeated multiplication of a number by itself. The number being multiplied is called the **base**, and the number of times it is multiplied is called the **exponent** or **index**. For example, $2^3$ means $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$, which equals $8$.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a power is:\r\n$a^n = \\underbrace{a \\times a \\times \\cdots \\times a}_\\text{n times}$\r\n\r\nwhere $a$ is the base and $n$ is the exponent.\r\n\r\n### Laws of Indices\r\nThe laws of indices help us simplify expressions involving powers. Here are the main laws:\r\n\r\n| Law | Formula |\r\n|-----|---------|\r\n| Product Rule | $a^m \\times a^n = a^{m+n}$ |\r\n| Quotient Rule | $\\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$ |\r\n| Power Rule | $(a^m)^n = a^{m \\times n}$ |\r\n| Zero Exponent Rule | $a^0 = 1$ (for $a \\neq 0$) |\r\n| Negative Exponent Rule | $a^{-n} = \\frac{1}{a^n}$ |\r\n\r\n### Roots and Radicals\r\nA root is the inverse operation of a power. It helps us find the base when the exponent and the result are known. The most common roots are:\r\n\r\n- Square root ($\\sqrt{a}$): The number which, when multiplied by itself, gives $a$. For example, $\\sqrt{16} = 4$ because $4 \\times 4 = 16$.\r\n- Cube root ($\\sqrt[3]{a}$): The number which, when multiplied by itself three times, gives $a$. For example, $\\sqrt[3]{8} = 2$ because $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\r\n\r\nThe general form of a root is:\r\n$\\sqrt[n]{a} = b$ if and only if $b^n = a$\r\n\r\n### Properties of Roots\r\nHere are some important properties of roots:\r\n\r\n| Property | Formula |\r\n|----------|---------|\r\n| Product Property | $\\sqrt{a} \\times \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{ab}$ |\r\n| Quotient Property | $\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{b}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}}$ |\r\n| Power Property | $\\sqrt{a^n} = (\\sqrt{a})^n$ |\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram showing the relationship between powers and roots, with examples]\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Simplify the expression: $3^2 \\times 3^4$\r\n\r\n   Using the product rule: $3^2 \\times 3^4 = 3^{2+4} = 3^6 = 729$\r\n\r\n2. Evaluate: $\\sqrt{144} - \\sqrt[3]{64}$\r\n\r\n   $\\sqrt{144} = 12$ and $\\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$\r\n\r\n   Therefore, $\\sqrt{144} - \\sqrt[3]{64} = 12 - 4 = 8$\r\n\r\n3. Kofi is saving money in his mobile money account. If he saves GH₵50 per week, how much money will he have after 12 weeks?\r\n\r\n   We can use powers to solve this problem:\r\n   \r\n   Amount saved = GH₵50 $\\times$ $12$ weeks = GH₵50 $\\times$ $2^2 \\times 3$ = GH₵50 $\\times$ $4 \\times 3$ = GH₵600\r\n\r\n   Therefore, Kofi will have GH₵600 in his mobile money account after 12 weeks.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. Simplify: $(2^3)^4$\r\n2. Evaluate: $\\sqrt{81} + \\sqrt[3]{27}$\r\n3. Ama bought 5 bags of rice, each weighing 2 kg.

Understand the concept of standard form (scientific notation) for representing very large or very small numbers\r\n2. Convert numbers from standard form to ordinary numbers and vice versa\r\n3. Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with numbers in standard form\r\n4. Apply standard form to solve real-life problems involving very large or very small quantities\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we often encounter very large or very small numbers. For example, when buying goods at the market, you might deal with large amounts of money, such as GH₵1,000,000 for a wholesale purchase. On the other hand, when measuring the weight of small items like spices or seeds, you might work with very small quantities like 0.00001 kg. In science and technology, we also use very large and small numbers to express distances in space, sizes of atoms, or the speed of light. To make these numbers easier to work with, we use a concise representation called standard form or scientific notation. Learning standard form will help you in your BECE exams and future studies, as well as in practical applications like calculating profits in business or understanding scientific concepts.\r\n\r\n### Main Content\r\n#### What is Standard Form?\r\n**Standard form**, also known as **scientific notation**, is a way of writing very large or very small numbers in a concise and easily readable format. In standard form, a number is expressed as a product of a number between 1 and 10 (called the **coefficient**) and a power of 10 (called the **base**).\r\n\r\nThe general format of a number in standard form is:\r\n\r\n$a \\times 10^n$\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n- $a$ is the coefficient, a number between 1 and 10\r\n- $10$ is the base\r\n- $n$ is an integer (positive, negative, or zero)\r\n\r\nFor example, the number 1,000,000 can be written in standard form as $1 \\times 10^6$, and 0.00001 can be written as $1 \\times 10^{-5}$.\r\n\r\n#### Converting Numbers to Standard Form\r\nTo convert a number to standard form, follow these steps:\r\n1. Move the decimal point to the right or left until you have a number between 1 and 10 (the coefficient).\r\n2. Count the number of places you moved the decimal point. This will be the power of 10 (the exponent).\r\n   - If you moved the decimal point to the left, the exponent will be positive.\r\n   - If you moved the decimal point to the right, the exponent will be negative.\r\n3. Write the number as a product of the coefficient and the power of 10.\r\n\r\nFor example, to convert 123,456 to standard form:\r\n1. Move the decimal point 5 places to the left: 1.23456\r\n2. The exponent is positive 5: $10^5$\r\n3. The number in standard form is: $1.23456 \\times 10^5$\r\n\r\nTo convert 0.0078 to standard form:\r\n1. Move the decimal point 3 places to the right: 7.8\r\n2. The exponent is negative 3: $10^{-3}$\r\n3. The number in standard form is: $7.8 \\times 10^{-3}$\r\n\r\n#### Converting Numbers from Standard Form\r\nTo convert a number from standard form to an ordinary number, simply reverse the process:\r\n1. If the exponent is positive, move the decimal point to the right by the number of places indicated by the exponent.\r\n2. If the exponent is negative, move the decimal point to the left by the number of places indicated by the exponent.\r\n\r\nFor example, to convert $4.2 \\times 10^3$ to an ordinary number:\r\n1. The exponent is positive 3, so move the decimal point 3 places to the right: 4200\r\n\r\nTo convert $5.6 \\times 10^{-2}$ to an ordinary number:\r\n1. The exponent is negative 2, so move the decimal point 2 places to the left: 0.056\r\n\r\n#### Arithmetic Operations with Standard Form\r\nWhen performing arithmetic operations with numbers in standard form, follow these rules:\r\n\r\n| Operation | Rule | Example |\r\n|-----------|------|---------|\r\n| Addition and Subtraction | Convert numbers to the same power of 10, then add or subtract coefficients | $3 \\times 10^4 + 2 \\times 10^4 = (3 + 2) \\times 10^4 = 5 \\times 10^4$ |\r\n| Multiplication | Multiply coefficients and add exponents | $(2 \\times 10^3) \\times (4 \\times 10^5) = (2 \\times 4) \\times 10^{3+5} = 8 \\times 10^8$ |\r\n| Division | Divide coefficients and subtract exponents | $(6 \\times 10^7) \\div (2 \\times 10^4) = (6 \\div 2) \\times 10^{7-4} = 3 \\times 10^3$ |\r\n\r\n### Worked Examples\r\n1. The distance from Earth to the Sun is approximately 150,000,000 km. Express this distance in standard form.\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: Diagram showing the Earth and Sun with the distance between them labeled]\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   - Move the decimal point 8 places to the left: 1.5\r\n   - The exponent is positive 8: $10^8$\r\n   - The distance in standard form is: $1.5 \\times 10^8$ km\r\n\r\n2. A farmer has 0.0025 kg of tomato seeds. Express this weight in standard form.\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   - Move the decimal point 3 places to the right: 2.5\r\n   - The exponent is negative 3: $10^{-3}$\r\n   - The weight in standard form is: $2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ kg\r\n\r\n3. Calculate the product of $2 \\times 10^4$ and $3 \\times 10^{-2}$.\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   - Multiply the coefficients: $2 \\times 3 = 6$\r\n   - Add the exponents: $4 + (-2) = 2$\r\n   - The result is: $6 \\times 10^2 = 600$\r\n\r\n4. A company's annual profit increased from $5 \\times 10^6$ GH₵ to $8 \\times 10^6$ GH₵. Calculate the increase in profit.\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   - The numbers have the same exponent, so we can subtract the coefficients: $8 - 5 = 3$\r\n   - The increase in profit is: $3 \\times 10^6$ GH₵ or 3,000,000 GH₵\r\n\r\n### Practice Problems\r\n1. Convert 56,789,000 to standard form.\r\n2. Convert $9.1 \\times 10^{-4}$ to an ordinary number.\r\n3. Simplify $(4 \\times 10^5) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-3})$.\r\n4. A factory produces $1.2 \\times 10^4$ units per day.

Imagine you're at the market in Accra, and you want to quickly estimate the total cost of your groceries before reaching the cashier. Or perhaps you're a farmer in the Volta Region, and you need to approximate the yield of your maize harvest. In such cases, the mathematical skills of approximation and estimation become invaluable.\r\n\r\nApproximation and estimation are also crucial in preparing for the BECE (Basic Education Certificate Examination) in Ghana. These techniques allow you to check the reasonableness of your answers and solve problems more efficiently. By mastering these skills, you'll be well-equipped to tackle various mathematical challenges, both in academics and in real-life situations.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Rounding Numbers\r\nRounding is the process of replacing a number with a simplified value that is close to the original number. The basic rules for rounding are:\r\n\r\n1. Identify the place value to which you want to round (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands).\r\n2. Look at the digit to the right of the identified place value.\r\n3. If the digit is 5 or greater, round up by adding 1 to the digit in the identified place value. If the digit is less than 5, keep the digit in the identified place value unchanged.\r\n4. Replace all digits to the right of the identified place value with zeros.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's round 3,482 to the nearest hundred:\r\n1. The hundreds place is the second digit from the right.\r\n2. The digit to the right of the hundreds place is 8, which is greater than 5.\r\n3. Round up by adding 1 to the digit in the hundreds place: 3,500.\r\n4. Replace all digits to the right of the hundreds place with zeros: 3,500.\r\n\r\n### Estimating Sums and Differences\r\nTo estimate the sum or difference of two or more numbers:\r\n1. Round each number to a place value that makes the calculation easier (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands).\r\n2. Perform the operation (addition or subtraction) using the rounded numbers.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nEstimate the sum of 4,821 and 5,196.\r\n1. Round each number to the nearest thousand:\r\n   4,821 rounds to 5,000\r\n   5,196 rounds to 5,000\r\n2. Add the rounded numbers: 5,000 + 5,000 = 10,000\r\n\r\nTherefore, the estimated sum of 4,821 and 5,196 is 10,000.\r\n\r\n### Estimating Products and Quotients\r\nTo estimate the product or quotient of two numbers:\r\n1. Round each number to a place value that makes the calculation easier (e.g., tens, hundreds, thousands).\r\n2. Perform the operation (multiplication or division) using the rounded numbers.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nEstimate the product of 312 and 24.\r\n1. Round each number to the nearest hundred and ten, respectively:\r\n   312 rounds to 300\r\n   24 rounds to 20\r\n2. Multiply the rounded numbers: 300 × 20 = 6,000\r\n\r\nTherefore, the estimated product of 312 and 24 is 6,000.\r\n\r\n### Checking the Reasonableness of Answers\r\nAfter solving a problem, use estimation to check if your answer makes sense. If the estimated value is close to your calculated answer, it's likely that your answer is reasonable.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nCalculate: 2,931 + 4,157\r\nAnswer: 7,088\r\n\r\nTo check the reasonableness of the answer, estimate the sum by rounding each number to the nearest thousand:\r\n3,000 + 4,000 = 7,000\r\n\r\nThe estimated sum (7,000) is close to the calculated answer (7,088), so the answer is reasonable.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Kofi wants to buy a bag of rice for GH₵ 45.50 and a container of cooking oil for GH₵ 19.75.

Understand the importance and purpose of the BODMAS rule.\r\n2. Correctly apply the BODMAS rule to evaluate arithmetic expressions.\r\n3. Simplify complex expressions using the order of operations.\r\n4. Solve real-life problems involving multiple arithmetic operations.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nMathematics is an essential tool in our daily lives, whether we are buying goods at the market, calculating the cost of mobile money transactions, or measuring land for farming. As Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE exams, it is crucial to have a strong foundation in arithmetic and the order of operations. The BODMAS rule helps us to solve complex expressions consistently and accurately, ensuring that we arrive at the correct answer every time. By mastering this concept, you will be well-prepared for the challenges of the BECE mathematics exam and equipped to handle real-life situations involving calculations with the Ghana cedi currency and other measurements.\r\n\r\n### Main Content\r\n#### Understanding the BODMAS Rule\r\nThe BODMAS rule is an acronym that stands for the order in which arithmetic operations should be performed: **Brackets**, **Orders** (powers and roots), **Division**, **Multiplication**, **Addition**, and **Subtraction**. When evaluating an expression, follow the BODMAS rule to ensure the correct order of operations.\r\n\r\n| Operation | Symbol | Order |\r\n|-----------|--------|-------|\r\n| Brackets  | ( )    | 1st   |\r\n| Orders    | ^, √   | 2nd   |\r\n| Division  | ÷      | 3rd   |\r\n| Multiplication | ×  | 4th   |\r\n| Addition  | +      | 5th   |\r\n| Subtraction | -    | 6th   |\r\n\r\n#### Applying BODMAS to Simple Expressions\r\nTo apply the BODMAS rule, follow these steps:\r\n1. Evaluate expressions within **brackets** first.\r\n2. Calculate **orders** (powers and roots).\r\n3. Perform **division** and **multiplication** from left to right.\r\n4. Perform **addition** and **subtraction** from left to right.\r\n\r\nFor example, simplify the expression: 12 + (6 - 3) × 4 ÷ 2^2\r\n1. Brackets: 12 + (3) × 4 ÷ 2^2\r\n2. Orders: 12 + 3 × 4 ÷ 4\r\n3. Division and Multiplication (left to right): 12 + 12 ÷ 4\r\n4. Division and Multiplication (left to right): 12 + 3\r\n5. Addition: 15\r\n\r\n#### Simplifying Complex Expressions\r\nWhen faced with more complex expressions, break them down into smaller parts and apply the BODMAS rule step by step.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A complex arithmetic expression with multiple brackets, orders, division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction operations. The expression should be broken down into smaller parts to demonstrate the step-by-step application of BODMAS.]\r\n\r\nFollow these steps to simplify complex expressions:\r\n1.

Expand single brackets with positive and negative terms.\r\n2. Expand double brackets.\r\n3. Apply the FOIL method to expand two binomials.\r\n4. Solve real-life problems involving expanding brackets.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nAlgebra is a crucial branch of mathematics that helps us solve problems using symbols and equations. In Ghana, algebra is used in various aspects of daily life, such as calculating profits at the market, managing mobile money transactions, and determining the amount of fertilizer needed for a farm based on its size. Mastering the skill of expanding brackets is essential for Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE examination, as it forms a strong foundation for solving complex algebraic problems.\r\n\r\nImagine you are helping your mother sell vegetables at the market. If she knows the cost price and selling price of each vegetable, you can use algebra to calculate her profit by expanding the brackets in the expression: (selling price - cost price) × number of vegetables sold. By learning how to expand brackets, you will be equipped to solve such problems easily and quickly.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Expanding Single Brackets\r\nTo expand a single bracket, multiply each term inside the bracket by the term outside the bracket. For example:\r\n- 2(x + 3) = 2x + 6\r\n- 3(2x - 1) = 6x - 3\r\n- -4(3x + 2) = -12x - 8\r\n\r\n### Expanding Double Brackets\r\nWhen expanding double brackets, multiply each term in the first bracket by each term in the second bracket. For example:\r\n- (x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 5x + 6\r\n- (2x - 1)(3x + 4) = 6x^2 + 5x - 4\r\n\r\n### FOIL Method\r\nThe FOIL method is a technique for expanding two binomials. FOIL stands for:\r\n- **F**irst terms\r\n- **O**uter terms\r\n- **I**nner terms\r\n- **L**ast terms\r\n\r\nTo use the FOIL method:\r\n1. Multiply the **First** terms of each bracket.\r\n2. Multiply the **Outer** terms (the first term of the first bracket and the last term of the second bracket).\r\n3. Multiply the **Inner** terms (the last term of the first bracket and the first term of the second bracket).\r\n4. Multiply the **Last** terms of each bracket.\r\n5. Add all the resulting terms together.\r\n\r\nFor example, to expand (2x + 3)(x - 4) using FOIL:\r\n1. First: 2x × x = 2x^2\r\n2. Outer: 2x × (-4) = -8x\r\n3. Inner: 3 × x = 3x\r\n4. Last: 3 × (-4) = -12\r\n5. Add the terms: 2x^2 - 5x - 12\r\n\r\nProperties of Expanding Brackets:\r\n| Property | Example |\r\n|----------|---------|\r\n| Distributive Property | a(b + c) = ab + ac |\r\n| Product of Sum and Difference | (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 |\r\n\r\nCommon Expansions:\r\n| Expression | Expansion |\r\n|------------|-----------|\r\n| (a + b)^2  | a^2 + 2ab + b^2 |\r\n| (a - b)^2  | a^2 - 2ab + b^2 |\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram showing the FOIL method with arrows connecting the terms being multiplied]\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Expand: 4(3x - 2)\r\n   Step 1: Multiply 4 by each term inside the bracket.\r\n   4(3x - 2) = 4 × 3x - 4 × 2\r\n             = 12x - 8\r\n\r\n2. Expand: (2x + 1)(x - 3)\r\n   Step 1: Use the FOIL method.\r\n   First: 2x × x = 2x^2\r\n   Outer: 2x × (-3) = -6x\r\n   Inner: 1 × x = x\r\n   Last: 1 × (-3) = -3\r\n\r\n   Step 2: Add the terms.\r\n   (2x + 1)(x - 3) = 2x^2 - 5x - 3\r\n\r\n3. Kofi is planning to buy a new phone. The phone's price is GH₵1,200, and he will also buy a case for GH₵50. If he plans to pay for the phone in 12 equal monthly installments, how much will each installment be?\r\n\r\n   Let the monthly installment be x.\r\n   Total cost = (Phone price + Case price)\r\n              = 1200 + 50\r\n              = 1250\r\n\r\n   Equation: 12x = 1250\r\n\r\n   Step 1: Divide both sides by 12.\r\n   x = 1250 ÷ 12\r\n   x = 104.17 (rounded to the nearest pesewa)\r\n\r\n   Therefore, each monthly installment will be GH₵104.17.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1.

Factor trinomials of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a \\neq 1$.\r\n4. Apply factorization to solve real-world problems involving area, perimeter, and money.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nFactorization is a crucial skill in algebra that allows us to break down expressions into their smaller components. This process is essential for simplifying expressions, solving equations, and understanding the structure of polynomials. In everyday life, factorization can be applied to various situations, such as calculating the dimensions of a rectangular plot of land given its area, determining the number of items that can be bought with a certain amount of Ghana cedis, or even estimating the number of bags of maize that can be transported in a truck. Mastering factorization will not only help you excel in your mathematics exams like the BECE but also develop problem-solving skills that will be valuable throughout your life.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Factoring out the Highest Common Factor (HCF)\r\nThe first step in factorization is to identify the highest common factor (HCF) of the terms in an algebraic expression. The HCF is the largest factor that divides all the terms without leaving a remainder. To factor out the HCF, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Identify the common factors of all terms in the expression.\r\n2. Find the highest common factor among these common factors.\r\n3. Divide each term by the HCF and write the result inside a pair of parentheses.\r\n4. Write the HCF outside the parentheses.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nFactor $12x^2 + 18x$\r\n\r\n$HCF(12x^2, 18x) = 6x$\r\n$12x^2 + 18x = 6x(2x + 3)$\r\n\r\n### Factoring Trinomials of the Form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a = 1$\r\nWhen factoring trinomials of the form $x^2 + bx + c$, we need to find two numbers whose sum is equal to $b$ and whose product is equal to $c$.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Write down the factors of $c$.\r\n2. Find a pair of factors whose sum is equal to $b$.\r\n3. Write the trinomial as the product of two binomials using the factors found in step 2.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nFactor $x^2 + 5x + 6$\r\n\r\nFactors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6\r\n1 + 6 = 7 (not equal to 5)\r\n2 + 3 = 5 (equal to 5)\r\n\r\n$x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)$\r\n\r\n### Factoring Trinomials of the Form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a \\neq 1$\r\nWhen factoring trinomials of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a \\neq 1$, we use the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Multiply $a$ and $c$.\r\n2. Find the factors of the product $ac$ that add up to $b$.\r\n3. Rewrite the trinomial using the factors found in step 2.\r\n4. Factor by grouping.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nFactor $2x^2 + 7x + 3$\r\n\r\n$ac = 2 \\times 3 = 6$\r\nFactors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6\r\n1 + 6 = 7 (equal to 7)\r\n\r\n$2x^2 + 7x + 3 = 2x^2 + x + 6x + 3$\r\n$= x(2x + 1) + 3(2x + 1)$\r\n$= (2x + 1)(x + 3)$\r\n\r\n### Applying Factorization to Real-World Problems\r\nFactorization can be used to solve various real-world problems, such as:\r\n\r\n- Finding the dimensions of a rectangular plot of land given its area\r\n- Calculating the number of items that can be bought with a certain amount of money\r\n- Determining the number of equal-sized groups that can be formed from a given number of objects\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A rectangular plot of land with length (x + 3) m and width (x + 2) m. The area of the plot is given as $x^2 + 5x + 6$ square meters.]\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nA rectangular plot of land has an area of $x^2 + 5x + 6$ square meters. If the length of the plot is $(x + 3)$ meters, find the width of the plot.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n$x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 3)(x + 2)$\r\nThe width of the plot is $(x + 2)$ meters.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1.

Kofi has GH₵ 24 to buy pens and notebooks. If each pen costs GH₵ 3 and each notebook costs GH₵ 6, find the number of pens and notebooks he can buy using the factorization method.\r\n\r\n   Let $x$ be the number of pens Kofi can buy.\r\n   Then, the number of notebooks he can buy is $\\frac{24 - 3x}{6} = 4 - \\frac{x}{2}$.\r\n\r\n   Total items bought = $x + (4 - \\frac{x}{2})$\r\n   $= x + 4 - \\frac{x}{2}$\r\n   $= \\frac{2x + 8 - x}{2}$\r\n   $= \\frac{x + 8}{2}$\r\n\r\n   To find the maximum number of items Kofi can buy, we factor the expression:\r\n   $x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4)$\r\n\r\n   The maximum value of $(x + 2)(x + 4)$ occurs when $x = 1$.\r\n\r\n   So, Kofi can buy 1 pen and 3 notebooks.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1.

Solve two-step linear equations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\r\n3. Translate word problems into linear equations and solve them\r\n4. Check the solution of a linear equation by substituting it back into the original equation\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nAlgebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with the manipulation of symbols and equations. In our daily lives as Ghanaian students, we often encounter situations that require algebraic thinking. For example, when buying items at the market, we need to calculate the total cost based on the price per unit and the number of units purchased. We also use algebra when converting between different units of measurement, such as kilograms and grams, or when calculating the amount of money we need to send via mobile money. Moreover, a strong foundation in algebra is essential for success in the BECE and WAEC exams, as it is a key component of the mathematics curriculum.\r\n\r\nIn this section, we will focus on solving linear equations, which are equations that involve variables raised to the first power (e.g., x, 2y, 3z). Mastering the techniques for solving linear equations will help you develop problem-solving skills and prepare you for more advanced mathematical concepts.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### One-step Linear Equations\r\nA one-step linear equation is an equation that can be solved in one operation, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nx + 5 = 12\r\nTo solve this equation, subtract 5 from both sides:\r\nx + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5\r\nx = 7\r\n\r\n### Two-step Linear Equations\r\nA two-step linear equation requires two operations to solve. To solve a two-step linear equation, first perform the addition or subtraction operation, then perform the multiplication or division operation.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n2x - 3 = 9\r\nFirst, add 3 to both sides:\r\n2x - 3 + 3 = 9 + 3\r\n2x = 12\r\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\r\n2x ÷ 2 = 12 ÷ 2\r\nx = 6\r\n\r\n### Translating Word Problems into Linear Equations\r\nMany real-life problems can be solved using linear equations. To solve a word problem, follow these steps:\r\n1. Identify the unknown quantity and assign a variable to it (e.g., x, y, z)\r\n2. Write an equation that represents the problem using the variable\r\n3. Solve the equation\r\n4. Check the solution by substituting it back into the original equation\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nKwame has GH₵150 in his mobile money account. He sends GH₵50 to his sister and GH₵30 to his brother. How much money does Kwame have left in his account?\r\n\r\nLet x be the amount of money Kwame has left.\r\nx = 150 - 50 - 30\r\nx = 70\r\nTherefore, Kwame has GH₵70 left in his mobile money account.\r\n\r\n### Properties of Equality\r\nWhen solving linear equations, it is important to understand the properties of equality. These properties allow us to perform operations on both sides of an equation without changing the solution.\r\n\r\n| Property | Description |\r\n|----------|-------------|\r\n| Addition Property of Equality | If a = b, then a + c = b + c |\r\n| Subtraction Property of Equality | If a = b, then a - c = b - c |\r\n| Multiplication Property of Equality | If a = b, then ac = bc |\r\n| Division Property of Equality | If a = b and c ≠ 0, then a ÷ c = b ÷ c |\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A balance scale with equal weights on both sides, illustrating the properties of equality]\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 25\r\n   3x + 7 - 7 = 25 - 7\r\n   3x = 18\r\n   3x ÷ 3 = 18 ÷ 3\r\n   x = 6\r\n\r\n2. Ama bought 5 kilograms of rice at the market. If she paid GH₵30 in total, what was the price per kilogram of rice?\r\n   Let x be the price per kilogram of rice.\r\n   5x = 30\r\n   5x ÷ 5 = 30 ÷ 5\r\n   x = 6\r\n   Therefore, the price per kilogram of rice was GH₵6.\r\n\r\n3. [IMAGE: A rectangular farm with a length 3 meters longer than its width]\r\n   The length of a rectangular farm is 3 meters longer than its width. If the perimeter of the farm is 26 meters, find the dimensions of the farm.\r\n   Let x be the width of the farm.\r\n   Length = x + 3\r\n   Perimeter = 2(length + width)\r\n   26 = 2(x + 3 + x)\r\n   26 = 2(2x + 3)\r\n   26 = 4x + 6\r\n   26 - 6 = 4x + 6 - 6\r\n   20 = 4x\r\n   20 ÷ 4 = 4x ÷ 4\r\n   5 = x\r\n   Width = 5 meters\r\n   Length = 5 + 3 = 8 meters\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1.

Solve linear inequalities in one variable\r\n3. Represent solutions of inequalities on a number line\r\n4. Apply inequalities to solve real-life problems\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nInequalities are an essential part of mathematics that help us compare quantities and make decisions in our daily lives. For example, when you go to the market in Ghana to buy ingredients for your favorite dish, you might compare prices to find the best deal. If one vendor sells a bag of rice for GH₵50 and another for GH₵45, you would choose the cheaper option, knowing that GH₵45 < GH₵50.\r\n\r\nInequalities are also crucial in preparing for the BECE exams. Understanding how to solve and represent inequalities will help you tackle various problems in the exam and improve your overall performance.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n\r\n### Understanding Inequalities\r\nAn **inequality** is a mathematical statement that compares two expressions using one of the following symbols:\r\n- Greater than (>)\r\n- Less than (<)\r\n- Greater than or equal to (≥)\r\n- Less than or equal to (≤)\r\n\r\nFor example, if we compare the heights of two students, Kofi and Ama, and Kofi is 160 cm tall while Ama is 155 cm tall, we can write the inequality: Kofi's height > Ama's height, or 160 cm > 155 cm.\r\n\r\n### Solving Linear Inequalities\r\nTo solve a linear inequality in one variable, we follow similar steps as solving linear equations, but with one important difference: when multiplying or dividing both sides of the inequality by a negative number, we must reverse the inequality symbol.\r\n\r\nSteps to solve linear inequalities:\r\n1. Isolate the variable on one side of the inequality by adding or subtracting the same value from both sides.\r\n2. Multiply or divide both sides by the same positive number to eliminate any coefficients.\r\n3. If multiplying or dividing by a negative number, reverse the inequality symbol.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's solve the inequality: 2x - 5 > 7\r\n1. Add 5 to both sides: 2x - 5 + 5 > 7 + 5\r\n   - Simplify: 2x > 12\r\n2. Divide both sides by 2: 2x ÷ 2 > 12 ÷ 2\r\n   - Simplify: x > 6\r\n\r\n### Representing Solutions on a Number Line\r\nThe solution to an inequality can be represented on a number line. Use an open circle (○) for strict inequalities (< or >) and a closed circle (●) for inclusive inequalities (≤ or ≥). Shade the portion of the number line that satisfies the inequality.\r\n\r\nFor the previous example, x > 6, we would represent the solution on a number line as follows:\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A number line with an open circle at 6 and shading extending to the right of 6, representing all values greater than 6]\r\n\r\n### Applying Inequalities to Real-Life Problems\r\nInequalities are useful in solving various real-life problems. For example, a farmer in Ghana wants to fence a rectangular field with a perimeter of at most 200 meters. If the length of the field is 60 meters, find the possible widths of the field.\r\n\r\nLet the width be w meters.\r\n- Perimeter of the rectangle = 2(length + width) ≤ 200\r\n- Substitute the length: 2(60 + w) ≤ 200\r\n- Solve the inequality:\r\n  - 120 + 2w ≤ 200\r\n  - 2w ≤ 80\r\n  - w ≤ 40\r\n\r\nTherefore, the width of the field must be less than or equal to 40 meters.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n\r\n1. Solve the inequality: 3(2x - 1) ≥ 15\r\n   - Distribute 3: 6x - 3 ≥ 15\r\n   - Add 3 to both sides: 6x - 3 + 3 ≥ 15 + 3\r\n     - Simplify: 6x ≥ 18\r\n   - Divide both sides by 6: 6x ÷ 6 ≥ 18 ÷ 6\r\n     - Simplify: x ≥ 3\r\n   \r\n   The solution is x ≥ 3.\r\n\r\n2. Represent the inequality -2 < x ≤ 4 on a number line.\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: A number line with an open circle at -2, a closed circle at 4, and shading between -2 and 4, representing all values greater than -2 and less than or equal to 4]\r\n\r\n3. Esi wants to buy a new phone that costs no more than GH₵1,500. She has already saved GH₵900. How much more money does she need to save to afford the phone?\r\n   \r\n   Let x be the additional amount Esi needs to save.\r\n   - Total saved + additional savings ≤ phone cost\r\n   - 900 + x ≤ 1,500\r\n   - Subtract 900 from both sides: x ≤ 600\r\n   \r\n   Therefore, Esi needs to save at most GH₵600 more to afford the phone.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. Solve the inequality: 5 - 2x < 11\r\n2. Represent the solution of -3 ≤ 2y - 1 on a number line.\r\n3. Kwame needs to score an average of at least 80% on his final exams to get an A grade. If he scored 85% and 78% on his first two exams, what's the lowest score he can get on his third exam to achieve an A grade?\r\n\r\nAnswers:\r\n1. x > -3\r\n2. [IMAGE: A number line with a closed circle at -1 and shading extending to the right of -1, representing all values greater than or equal to -1]\r\n3. Let the third exam score be x. (85 + 78 + x) ÷ 3 ≥ 80. Solve for x: x ≥ 77.

Apply simultaneous equations to solve real-life problems\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nAlgebra is a crucial branch of mathematics that deals with equations and variables. In your daily life in Ghana, you might encounter situations where you need to solve problems involving two or more unknowns. For example, when you go to the market to buy different types of fruits with a fixed amount of money, you need to determine how many of each fruit you can buy. This is where simultaneous equations come in handy. They help you solve problems with multiple unknowns by providing a set of equations that can be solved together.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous equations are also essential for your BECE exam preparation. You will encounter questions that require you to solve simultaneous equations to find the values of unknown variables. By mastering the techniques for solving simultaneous equations, you will be well-prepared to tackle these questions confidently.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### What are Simultaneous Equations?\r\nSimultaneous equations, also known as a system of linear equations, are two or more equations that share the same variables and are solved together to find the values of those variables. In other words, simultaneous equations are a set of equations that are true for the same values of the variables.\r\n\r\nThe general form of simultaneous equations with two variables, $x$ and $y$, is:\r\n\r\n$a_1x + b_1y = c_1$\r\n$a_2x + b_2y = c_2$\r\n\r\nwhere $a_1$, $b_1$, $c_1$, $a_2$, $b_2$, and $c_2$ are constants.\r\n\r\n### Solving Simultaneous Equations by Substitution\r\nOne method for solving simultaneous equations is substitution. The steps for solving simultaneous equations by substitution are:\r\n\r\n1. Choose one of the equations and solve for one variable in terms of the other.\r\n2. Substitute the expression for the variable in the other equation.\r\n3. Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.\r\n4. Substitute the value of the solved variable back into the expression from step 1 to find the value of the other variable.\r\n\r\n### Solving Simultaneous Equations by Elimination\r\nAnother method for solving simultaneous equations is elimination. The steps for solving simultaneous equations by elimination are:\r\n\r\n1. Multiply one or both equations by a constant to make the coefficients of one variable equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.\r\n2. Add the equations together to eliminate one variable.\r\n3. Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.\r\n4. Substitute the value of the solved variable into one of the original equations to find the value of the other variable.\r\n\r\n### Applying Simultaneous Equations to Real-Life Problems\r\nSimultaneous equations can be used to solve various real-life problems. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n1. Currency exchange: If you have a certain amount of Ghanaian Cedis and want to exchange them for US Dollars and Euros, you can use simultaneous equations to determine how much of each currency you can get.\r\n\r\n2. Mixing solutions: If you have two solutions with different concentrations of a substance and want to mix them to obtain a solution with a specific concentration, you can use simultaneous equations to determine the amounts of each solution needed.\r\n\r\n3. Mobile money transactions: If you have a certain amount of money in your mobile money account and want to send different amounts to two friends, you can use simultaneous equations to determine how much money will be left in your account after the transactions.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Solve the following simultaneous equations by substitution:\r\n   \r\n   $2x + 3y = 11$\r\n   $x - y = 1$\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: Graph showing the lines 2x + 3y = 11 and x - y = 1 intersecting at the point (2, 3)]\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   From the second equation, we can express $x$ in terms of $y$:\r\n   $x = y + 1$\r\n\r\n   Substitute this into the first equation:\r\n   $2(y + 1) + 3y = 11$\r\n   $2y + 2 + 3y = 11$\r\n   $5y + 2 = 11$\r\n   $5y = 9$\r\n   $y = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8$\r\n\r\n   Substitute $y = 1.8$ into $x = y + 1$:\r\n   $x = 1.8 + 1 = 2.8$\r\n\r\n   Therefore, the solution is $x = 2.8$ and $y = 1.8$.\r\n\r\n2.

Polygons can be classified based on the number of sides they have:\r\n\r\n| Number of Sides | Name of Polygon |\r\n|-----------------|-----------------|\r\n| 3               | Triangle        |\r\n| 4               | Quadrilateral   |\r\n| 5               | Pentagon        |\r\n| 6               | Hexagon         |\r\n| 7               | Heptagon        |\r\n| 8               | Octagon         |\r\n| 9               | Nonagon         |\r\n| 10              | Decagon         |\r\n\r\nPolygons can also be classified as **regular** or **irregular**. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all angles of equal measure, while an irregular polygon does not have these properties.\r\n\r\n### Sum of Interior Angles\r\nThe sum of the measures of the interior angles of a polygon depends on the number of sides it has. The formula for the sum of interior angles is:\r\n\r\nSum of interior angles = (n - 2) × 180°\r\n\r\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon.\r\n\r\nFor example, the sum of interior angles in a pentagon (5 sides) is:\r\n(5 - 2) × 180° = 3 × 180° = 540°\r\n\r\n### Exterior Angles\r\nAn **exterior angle** of a polygon is formed by extending one of its sides. The sum of the measures of the exterior angles of any polygon is always 360°.\r\n\r\nIn a regular polygon, each exterior angle has the same measure, which can be calculated using the formula:\r\n\r\nMeasure of each exterior angle = 360° ÷ n\r\n\r\nwhere n is the number of sides of the polygon.\r\n\r\nFor example, in a regular hexagon (6 sides), the measure of each exterior angle is:\r\n360° ÷ 6 = 60°\r\n\r\n### Relation between Interior and Exterior Angles\r\nIn any polygon, the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. This property can be used to solve problems involving angles in polygons.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram showing the relationship between an exterior angle and its two non-adjacent interior angles in a polygon]\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n\r\n### Example 1\r\nCalculate the measure of each interior angle in a regular octagon.\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n- The polygon is a regular octagon (8 sides)\r\n\r\nStep 1: Calculate the sum of interior angles using the formula (n - 2) × 180°\r\nSum of interior angles = (8 - 2) × 180° = 6 × 180° = 1080°\r\n\r\nStep 2: Divide the sum of interior angles by the number of sides to find the measure of each interior angle\r\nMeasure of each interior angle = 1080° ÷ 8 = 135°\r\n\r\nTherefore, each interior angle in a regular octagon measures 135°.\r\n\r\n### Example 2\r\nIn a regular polygon, each exterior angle measures 24°. How many sides does the polygon have?\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n- Each exterior angle measures 24°\r\n\r\nStep 1: Use the formula for the measure of each exterior angle in a regular polygon\r\nMeasure of each exterior angle = 360° ÷ n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Substitute the given value and solve for n\r\n24° = 360° ÷ n\r\nn = 360° ÷ 24° = 15\r\n\r\nTherefore, the regular polygon has 15 sides.\r\n\r\n### Example 3\r\nA farmer in the Brong-Ahafo Region wants to fence a triangular portion of his land. If two of the interior angles measure 60° and 70°, find the measure of the third interior angle.\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n- The land is in the shape of a triangle\r\n- Two interior angles measure 60° and 70°\r\n\r\nStep 1: Recall that the sum of interior angles in a triangle is 180°\r\n\r\nStep 2: Subtract the given angles from 180° to find the measure of the third angle\r\nThird angle = 180° - (60° + 70°) = 180° - 130° = 50°\r\n\r\nTherefore, the third interior angle of the triangular land measures 50°.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. Calculate the sum of interior angles in a decagon.\r\n2. In a regular polygon, each interior angle measures 156°. How many sides does the polygon have?\r\n3.

State the Pythagoras theorem and identify the hypotenuse and other sides of a right-angled triangle\r\n2. Apply the Pythagoras theorem to calculate missing sides in a right-angled triangle\r\n3. Solve real-life problems involving right-angled triangles using the Pythagoras theorem\r\n4. Determine whether a triangle is right-angled based on its side lengths\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nThe Pythagoras theorem is a fundamental concept in mathematics that has numerous applications in our daily lives. In Ghana, we encounter right-angled triangles in various situations, such as calculating the height of a tree or the diagonal distance across a farm plot. Mastering the Pythagoras theorem is essential for success in the BECE mathematics exam, as it frequently appears in questions related to geometry and mensuration.\r\n\r\nImagine you are helping your family at the market, and you need to calculate the shortest distance from one corner of the market to the opposite corner. By understanding and applying the Pythagoras theorem, you can easily determine this distance and save time navigating through the crowded market stalls. Similarly, when dealing with mobile money transactions or currency conversions, the Pythagoras theorem can help you make accurate calculations involving right-angled triangles.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### The Pythagoras Theorem\r\nThe Pythagoras theorem states that in a **right-angled triangle**, the square of the length of the **hypotenuse** (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (called the **adjacent** and **opposite** sides).\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A right-angled triangle with sides labeled a, b, and c, where c is the hypotenuse]\r\n\r\nMathematically, the theorem can be expressed as:\r\n\r\n$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$\r\n\r\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the adjacent and opposite sides, respectively, and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse.\r\n\r\n### Applying the Pythagoras Theorem\r\nTo find the missing side in a right-angled triangle using the Pythagoras theorem, follow these steps:\r\n1. Identify the hypotenuse and the other two sides\r\n2. Substitute the known values into the Pythagoras theorem equation\r\n3. Simplify the equation and solve for the missing side\r\n\r\nFor example, if the adjacent side ($a$) is 3 cm and the hypotenuse ($c$) is 5 cm, we can find the opposite side ($b$) using:\r\n\r\n$3^2 + b^2 = 5^2$\r\n$9 + b^2 = 25$\r\n$b^2 = 16$\r\n$b = 4$ cm\r\n\r\n### Common Pythagorean Triples\r\nCertain sets of numbers, called **Pythagorean triples**, always satisfy the Pythagoras theorem. Some common Pythagorean triples are:\r\n\r\n| a   | b   | c   |\r\n|-----|-----|-----|\r\n| 3   | 4   | 5   |\r\n| 5   | 12  | 13  |\r\n| 8   | 15  | 17  |\r\n| 7   | 24  | 25  |\r\n\r\nMemorizing these triples can help you quickly solve problems involving right-angled triangles.\r\n\r\n### Determining Right-Angled Triangles\r\nTo check if a triangle is right-angled given its side lengths, follow these steps:\r\n1. Square each side length\r\n2. Add the squares of the two shorter sides\r\n3. Compare the sum with the square of the longest side\r\n4. If the sum equals the square of the longest side, the triangle is right-angled\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. A ladder leans against a wall, forming a right angle with the ground. The ladder is 6 m long, and the base of the ladder is 2 m away from the wall. How high up the wall does the ladder reach?\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A ladder leaning against a wall, forming a right-angled triangle]\r\n\r\nLet the height of the ladder on the wall be $h$.\r\nUsing the Pythagoras theorem: $2^2 + h^2 = 6^2$\r\n$4 + h^2 = 36$\r\n$h^2 = 32$\r\n$h = \\sqrt{32} = 4\\sqrt{2}$ m\r\n\r\nTherefore, the ladder reaches a height of $4\\sqrt{2}$ m up the wall.\r\n\r\n2.

Identify and differentiate between various 3D solids (cubes, cuboids, cylinders, cones, spheres)\r\n2. Apply the appropriate formulas to calculate the volume of different solids\r\n3. Solve real-life problems involving the volume of solids\r\n4. Convert between different units of volume (e.g., cm³ to m³)\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we encounter various three-dimensional objects, from the containers we use to store food and water to the buildings we live and work in. Understanding how to calculate the volume of these objects is crucial for many real-life applications. For example, a farmer in Ghana may need to determine the amount of water a cylindrical tank can hold to irrigate their crops efficiently. Market traders often need to estimate the volume of goods they can store in their stalls or transport in boxes. As you prepare for your BECE exams, mastering the concepts of volume will not only help you succeed academically but also equip you with practical skills for everyday life and future careers.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Types of Solids\r\nIn this section, we will focus on the following 3D solids:\r\n- **Cubes**: A solid with six equal square faces\r\n- **Cuboids**: A solid with six rectangular faces\r\n- **Cylinders**: A solid with two circular bases connected by a curved surface\r\n- **Cones**: A solid with a circular base and a single vertex at the top\r\n- **Spheres**: A solid with a curved surface, where all points are equidistant from the center\r\n\r\n### Formulas for Volume\r\nTo calculate the volume of solids, we use the following formulas:\r\n\r\n| Solid   | Formula                           |\r\n|---------|-----------------------------------|\r\n| Cube    | $V = s^3$                         |\r\n| Cuboid  | $V = l \\times w \\times h$         |\r\n| Cylinder| $V = \\pi r^2 h$                   |\r\n| Cone    | $V = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi r^2 h$       |\r\n| Sphere  | $V = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi r^3$         |\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n- $V$ is the volume\r\n- $s$ is the length of a side (cube)\r\n- $l$ is the length (cuboid)\r\n- $w$ is the width (cuboid)\r\n- $h$ is the height\r\n- $r$ is the radius\r\n- $\\pi$ is the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159)\r\n\r\n### Unit Conversion\r\nVolume is typically measured in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm³), cubic meters (m³), or liters (L). To convert between units, use the following relationships:\r\n- 1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³\r\n- 1 m³ = 1,000 L\r\n- 1 L = 1,000 cm³\r\n\r\n### Solving Volume Problems\r\nWhen solving volume problems, follow these steps:\r\n1.

Identify the coordinates of points on the Cartesian plane\r\n3. Calculate the distance between two points on the Cartesian plane\r\n4. Determine the midpoint of a line segment on the Cartesian plane\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nThe Cartesian plane is a fundamental concept in mathematics that allows us to represent points and shapes using coordinates. In Ghana, we use coordinate geometry in various aspects of our daily lives. For example, when you visit the market to buy groceries, the stall arrangements can be thought of as a grid system, similar to the Cartesian plane. Each stall can be located using its unique \"coordinates\" based on its row and column.\r\n\r\nAnother example is in mobile money transactions. When you transfer money to a friend, the mobile money app often displays a confirmation screen with a QR code. This QR code contains information about the transaction, such as the amount and the recipient's phone number, which can be represented as coordinates on a plane.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the Cartesian plane is also crucial for success in the BECE and WAEC exams. Coordinate geometry problems frequently appear in these exams, so mastering this topic will help you excel in your mathematics assessments.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### The Cartesian Plane\r\nThe Cartesian plane, also known as the coordinate plane, is a two-dimensional plane formed by the intersection of a horizontal number line (the x-axis) and a vertical number line (the y-axis) at right angles. The point of intersection is called the **origin** and has the coordinates (0, 0).\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A Cartesian plane with the x-axis and y-axis labeled, and the origin marked at (0, 0)]\r\n\r\n### Plotting Points\r\nTo plot a point on the Cartesian plane, we use an **ordered pair** (x, y), where x represents the position along the x-axis, and y represents the position along the y-axis. The first coordinate (x) is called the **abscissa**, and the second coordinate (y) is called the **ordinate**.\r\n\r\nFor example, to plot the point (3, 4):\r\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0)\r\n2. Move 3 units to the right along the x-axis\r\n3. Move 4 units up parallel to the y-axis\r\n4. Mark the point at the final position\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A Cartesian plane with the point (3, 4) plotted]\r\n\r\n### Distance Between Two Points\r\nTo find the distance between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) on the Cartesian plane, we use the distance formula:\r\n\r\nDistance = √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²)\r\n\r\nThis formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, as the distance between two points forms the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.\r\n\r\n### Midpoint of a Line Segment\r\nThe midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides the segment into two equal parts. To find the midpoint (x₀, y₀) of a line segment with endpoints (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), we use the midpoint formulas:\r\n\r\nx₀ = (x₁ + x₂) ÷ 2\r\ny₀ = (y₁ + y₂) ÷ 2\r\n\r\nIn other words, the midpoint coordinates are the averages of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the endpoints.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1.

Solve problems involving coordinates and distances in real-world contexts\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nCoordinate geometry is an essential part of mathematics that connects algebra and geometry. It has many applications in everyday life, such as using GPS coordinates to locate places on a map or designing buildings and structures. In Ghana, coordinate geometry is used in various fields, including surveying land for farming, planning urban development, and even in mobile money transactions to track the flow of funds.\r\n\r\nAs Ghanaian students prepare for the BECE exams, mastering coordinate geometry will not only help them excel in their tests but also develop problem-solving skills that are valuable in their future careers. By understanding how to plot points and calculate distances on a coordinate plane, students can solve practical problems involving measurements and locations.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### The Cartesian Coordinate Plane\r\nThe Cartesian coordinate plane is a two-dimensional surface formed by two perpendicular number lines: the **horizontal axis** (also called the x-axis) and the **vertical axis** (also called the y-axis). The point where these axes intersect is called the **origin** and has coordinates (0, 0).\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A Cartesian coordinate plane with x-axis and y-axis labeled, origin marked, and four quadrants labeled (I, II, III, IV)]\r\n\r\nThe coordinate plane is divided into four regions called **quadrants**, labeled with Roman numerals I, II, III, and IV.\r\n\r\n### Plotting Points\r\nTo plot a point on the coordinate plane, we use an **ordered pair** of numbers called **coordinates**. The first number represents the position on the x-axis (called the **x-coordinate** or **abscissa**), and the second number represents the position on the y-axis (called the **y-coordinate** or **ordinate**). The coordinates are written in the form (x, y).\r\n\r\nTo plot a point with coordinates (x, y):\r\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0)\r\n2. Move horizontally along the x-axis:\r\n   - To the right if x is positive\r\n   - To the left if x is negative\r\n3. Move vertically along the y-axis:\r\n   - Up if y is positive\r\n   - Down if y is negative\r\n4. Mark the point where the two movements intersect\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A coordinate plane with points A(3, 2), B(-2, 4), C(-1, -3), and D(4, -1) plotted and labeled]\r\n\r\n### Distance between Two Points\r\nTo find the distance between two points on a coordinate plane, we use the **distance formula**:\r\n\r\n$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\r\n\r\nwhere $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.\r\n\r\nSteps to find the distance:\r\n1. Identify the coordinates of the two points\r\n2. Substitute the coordinates into the distance formula\r\n3. Simplify the expression under the square root\r\n4. Calculate the square root to find the distance\r\n\r\n### Applying Coordinate Geometry\r\nCoordinate geometry has many applications in real-world problems. For example:\r\n- Calculating the distance between two towns on a map\r\n- Determining the perimeter and area of a plot of land\r\n- Designing floor plans for buildings\r\n- Analyzing data on a graph\r\n\r\nBy understanding how to plot points and calculate distances, students can solve these types of problems efficiently and accurately.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1.

The point where the axes intersect is called the **origin** and has coordinates (0, 0). Points on the coordinate plane are represented as ordered pairs (x, y), where x is the horizontal distance from the origin and y is the vertical distance.\r\n\r\nTo plot a point:\r\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0)\r\n2. Move horizontally along the x-axis according to the x-coordinate (positive values move right, negative values move left)\r\n3. Move vertically along the y-axis according to the y-coordinate (positive values move up, negative values move down)\r\n4. Mark the point at the final location\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A Cartesian coordinate plane with several points plotted, including (2, 3), (-1, 4), (0, -2), and (-3, -1).

It is calculated using the following formula:\r\n\r\n$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$\r\n\r\nwhere $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are two points on the line.\r\n\r\nTo find the gradient:\r\n1.

Identify the gradient (m) and y-intercept (c)\r\n2. Substitute the values into the slope-intercept form: $y = mx + c$\r\n\r\nExample: Write the equation of a line with gradient 3 and y-intercept -2.\r\n\r\n$m = 3$, $c = -2$\r\nEquation: $y = 3x - 2$\r\n\r\n### Determining the Equation of a Line\r\nTo find the equation of a line given its graph or two points:\r\n1. If given the graph, identify the gradient (m) and y-intercept (c), then use the slope-intercept form\r\n2. If given two points, first calculate the gradient (m) using the gradient formula\r\n3. Substitute one of the points and the gradient into the slope-intercept form\r\n4. Solve for c (the y-intercept)\r\n5.

It allows us to represent points, lines, and shapes on a coordinate plane using numbers. In Ghana, coordinate geometry has many practical applications. For example, when selling goods at the market, vendors often arrange their products in a grid-like pattern, similar to a coordinate plane. Understanding coordinate geometry can also help in calculating distances between towns or cities, which is crucial for transportation and logistics. Additionally, as you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering coordinate geometry will give you a strong foundation for solving various mathematical problems.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, we will focus on the concepts of gradient and y-intercept, which are essential for understanding lines in coordinate geometry. We will explore how to calculate the gradient of a line, determine the equation of a line, and solve problems involving parallel and perpendicular lines.

It represents the change in y-coordinate divided by the change in x-coordinate between any two points on the line. The gradient is denoted by the letter **m**.\r\n\r\nFormula for gradient:\r\n$$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$\r\n\r\nwhere $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are two points on the line.\r\n\r\n| Gradient | Description |\r\n|----------|-------------|\r\n| $m > 0$  | Line slopes upwards from left to right |\r\n| $m < 0$  | Line slopes downwards from left to right |\r\n| $m = 0$  | Line is horizontal |\r\n| $m$ is undefined | Line is vertical |\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A coordinate plane showing lines with different gradients (positive, negative, zero, and undefined)]\r\n\r\n### Equation of a Line\r\nThe **equation of a line** is a formula that represents all the points on a line.

Understand and apply the Cartesian coordinate system\r\n2. Find the coordinates of points on a coordinate plane\r\n3. Calculate the distance between two points using the distance formula\r\n4. Solve real-world problems involving distance in a coordinate plane\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we often need to find the distance between two locations. For example, when you visit the market in Accra, you might want to know the distance between your home and the market to estimate the transportation cost. Or, if you are helping on a farm, you may need to calculate the distance between two points in a field to determine the length of a fence or the area of a plot. Understanding coordinate geometry and the distance formula will help you solve these problems easily.\r\n\r\nCoordinate geometry is also an essential topic for the BECE examination. By mastering the concepts in this section, you will be well-prepared to tackle distance-related questions on the exam and achieve excellent results.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### The Cartesian Coordinate System\r\nThe Cartesian coordinate system, named after the mathematician René Descartes, is a way to describe the position of points on a flat surface called a **coordinate plane**. The coordinate plane consists of two perpendicular lines called the **x-axis** (horizontal) and the **y-axis** (vertical), which intersect at a point called the **origin**. The origin has the coordinates (0, 0).\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A coordinate plane with the x-axis, y-axis, origin, and a point P(x, y) labeled]\r\n\r\n### Coordinates of Points\r\nAny point on the coordinate plane can be described by an ordered pair of numbers **(x, y)**, where **x** represents the distance from the origin along the x-axis, and **y** represents the distance from the origin along the y-axis. The x-value is called the **abscissa**, and the y-value is called the **ordinate**.\r\n\r\nTo find the coordinates of a point:\r\n1. Start at the origin (0, 0)\r\n2. Move horizontally along the x-axis (right for positive values, left for negative values)\r\n3. Move vertically along the y-axis (up for positive values, down for negative values)\r\n\r\n### The Distance Formula\r\nThe distance between two points on a coordinate plane can be calculated using the **distance formula**. For two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the distance $d$ between them is given by:\r\n\r\n$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\r\n\r\nThis formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A right-angled triangle on a coordinate plane with the horizontal and vertical sides labeled as $(x_2 - x_1)$ and $(y_2 - y_1)$, and the hypotenuse labeled as $d$]\r\n\r\n### Properties of the Distance Formula\r\nThe distance formula has the following properties:\r\n1. Distance is always positive or zero\r\n2. Distance is symmetric, meaning the distance from point A to point B is the same as the distance from point B to point A\r\n3. The distance between a point and itself is zero\r\n\r\n| Property | Mathematical Expression |\r\n|----------|-------------------------|\r\n| Non-negativity | $d \\geq 0$ |\r\n| Symmetry | $d(A, B) = d(B, A)$ |\r\n| Zero distance | $d(A, A) = 0$ |\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n### Example 1\r\nFind the distance between the points A(2, 3) and B(5, 7).\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nLet's use the distance formula with $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 3)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (5, 7)$.\r\n\r\n$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\r\n$d = \\sqrt{(5 - 2)^2 + (7 - 3)^2}$\r\n$d = \\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}$\r\n$d = \\sqrt{9 + 16}$\r\n$d = \\sqrt{25}$\r\n$d = 5$\r\n\r\nTherefore, the distance between points A and B is 5 units.\r\n\r\n### Example 2\r\nKofi wants to calculate the distance between his house at (3, 4) and his friend Ama's house at (-2, 1) on a coordinate plane where each unit represents 100 meters. How far apart are their houses?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nLet's use the distance formula with $(x_1, y_1) = (3, 4)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (-2, 1)$.\r\n\r\n$d = \\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$\r\n$d = \\sqrt{(-2 - 3)^2 + (1 - 4)^2}$\r\n$d = \\sqrt{(-5)^2 + (-3)^2}$\r\n$d = \\sqrt{25 + 9}$\r\n$d = \\sqrt{34}$\r\n$d \\approx 5.83$\r\n\r\nSince each unit represents 100 meters, the actual distance is:\r\n$5.83 \\times 100 = 583$ meters\r\n\r\nTherefore, Kofi's house and Ama's house are approximately 583 meters apart.\r\n\r\n### Example 3\r\nA farmer in Kumasi has a rectangular plot of land with corners at (0, 0), (0, 6), (8, 6), and (8, 0). Find the length and width of the plot.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A rectangular plot on a coordinate plane with the corners labeled]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nTo find the length and width, we need to calculate the distances between the appropriate pairs of corners.\r\n\r\nLength (distance between (0, 0) and (8, 0)):\r\n$d = \\sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{64 + 0} = \\sqrt{64} = 8$\r\n\r\nWidth (distance between (0, 0) and (0, 6)):\r\n$d = \\sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (6 - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 36} = \\sqrt{36} = 6$\r\n\r\nTherefore, the length of the plot is 8 units, and the width is 6 units.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1.

From analyzing market prices of goods to tracking your mobile money transactions, understanding how to represent and interpret data is a crucial skill. Pie charts and line graphs are two powerful tools that allow you to visualize data effectively. Mastering these concepts will not only help you excel in your BECE exams but also enable you to make informed decisions in your future careers, whether you aspire to be a successful farmer, a business owner, or a financial analyst.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, we will explore the world of pie charts and line graphs, learning how to construct them, interpret the data they represent, and apply this knowledge to solve real-world problems. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid foundation in these statistical tools, empowering you to analyze data with confidence and accuracy.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Pie Charts\r\nA **pie chart** is a circular graph divided into sectors, where each sector represents a proportion of the whole. The size of each sector is determined by the percentage of the total data it represents. Pie charts are useful for displaying the composition of a whole, such as the distribution of crops on a farm or the breakdown of expenses in a household budget.\r\n\r\nTo construct a pie chart:\r\n1. Calculate the percentage each category contributes to the total.\r\n2. Multiply each percentage by 360° to determine the angle for each sector.\r\n3. Use a protractor to draw the angles and construct the pie chart.\r\n\r\nThe formula for calculating the angle of a sector:\r\n$$\\text{Angle of sector} = \\frac{\\text{Value of category}}{\\text{Total value}} \\times 360°$$\r\n\r\n| Category | Value | Percentage | Angle |\r\n|----------|-------|------------|-------|\r\n| A        | 25    | 25%        | 90°   |\r\n| B        | 40    | 40%        | 144°  |\r\n| C        | 35    | 35%        | 126°  |\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A pie chart showing the distribution of categories A, B, and C with their respective angles and percentages]\r\n\r\n### Line Graphs\r\nA **line graph** is a visual representation of how data changes over time or how two variables are related. Line graphs are created by plotting data points on a coordinate plane and connecting them with straight lines. They are commonly used to display trends, such as changes in market prices, population growth, or temperature variations.\r\n\r\nTo create a line graph:\r\n1. Identify the independent variable (usually time) and the dependent variable (the quantity being measured).\r\n2. Draw and label the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes with appropriate scales.\r\n3. Plot the data points on the coordinate plane.\r\n4. Connect the points with straight lines.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A line graph showing the change in price of a commodity over time, with the x-axis representing years and the y-axis representing price in GH₵]\r\n\r\n### Interpreting Pie Charts and Line Graphs\r\nWhen analyzing pie charts and line graphs, consider the following:\r\n- Identify the main categories or variables represented.\r\n- Look for dominant sectors or trends in the data.\r\n- Compare sizes of sectors or slopes of lines to make comparisons.\r\n- Use the data to draw conclusions and make predictions.\r\n\r\n### Solving Problems with Pie Charts and Line Graphs\r\nTo solve problems using pie charts and line graphs:\r\n1. Read the question carefully and identify the given information.\r\n2. Determine the type of graph or chart required to answer the question.\r\n3. Analyze the graph or chart, focusing on the relevant data.\r\n4. Perform necessary calculations using the provided data.\r\n5. Interpret the results and provide a clear answer to the question.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. A farmer's land is divided into four crop areas: Maize (50%), Yam (25%), Cassava (15%), and Plantain (10%). If the total land area is 120 hectares, calculate the area allocated to each crop.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Maize: 50% of 120 ha = 0.5 × 120 = 60 ha\r\n- Yam: 25% of 120 ha = 0.25 × 120 = 30 ha\r\n- Cassava: 15% of 120 ha = 0.15 × 120 = 18 ha\r\n- Plantain: 10% of 120 ha = 0.1 × 120 = 12 ha\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A pie chart representing the distribution of crops on the farmer's land]\r\n\r\n2. The line graph below shows the population growth of a Ghanaian town over 5 years. Calculate the average annual population increase.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A line graph displaying the population of a town increasing from 10,000 in Year 1 to 25,000 in Year 5]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Population increase = 25,000 - 10,000 = 15,000\r\n- Number of years = 5\r\n- Average annual increase = 15,000 ÷ 5 = 3,000 people per year\r\n\r\n3. A school canteen sells three types of food: Waakye (45%), Jollof (35%), and Fufu (20%). If the canteen sells a total of 800 plates per day, how many plates of each type of food are sold?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Waakye: 45% of 800 = 0.45 × 800 = 360 plates\r\n- Jollof: 35% of 800 = 0.35 × 800 = 280 plates\r\n- Fufu: 20% of 800 = 0.2 × 800 = 160 plates\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A pie chart showing the distribution of food types sold in the school canteen]\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. A mobile money agent's transactions in a day consist of Deposits (60%), Withdrawals (30%), and Transfers (10%). If the total transactions amount to GH₵5,000, calculate the value of each type of transaction.\r\n\r\n2. The line graph below shows the price of a bag of cement over 6 months. Calculate the percentage increase in the price from Month 1 to Month 6.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A line graph showing the price of a bag of cement increasing from GH₵30 in Month 1 to GH₵45 in Month 6]\r\n\r\n3. A survey of 1,200 BECE candidates reveals that 40% prefer Mathematics, 35% prefer Science, and the rest prefer English. Represent this information in a pie chart and calculate the number of candidates who prefer English.\r\n\r\nAnswers:\r\n1. Deposits: GH₵3,000, Withdrawals: GH₵1,500, Transfers: GH₵500\r\n2. 50% increase\r\n3. English: 25% (300 candidates)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- Pie charts display the composition of a whole, using sectors to represent percentages.\r\n- Line graphs show how data changes over time or how two variables are related.\r\n- To construct a pie chart, calculate percentages and angles for each sector.\r\n- To create a line graph, plot data points on a coordinate plane and connect them with lines.\r\n- Analyze pie charts and line graphs by identifying categories, trends, and making comparisons.\r\n- Solve problems by identifying given information, analyzing the graph, performing calculations, and interpreting results.\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n| Term/Formula | Meaning/Use |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| Pie Chart    | A circular graph divided into sectors representing proportions of a whole |\r\n| Line Graph   | A graph showing how data changes over time or how two variables are related |\r\n| Percentage   | A part expressed as a fraction of 100 |\r\n| Angle of Sector | $\\frac{\\text{Value of category}}{\\text{Total value}} \\times 360°$ |\r\n| Independent Variable | The variable that is being manipulated or changed (usually plotted on the x-axis) |\r\n| Dependent Variable | The variable that is being measured or affected (usually plotted on the y-axis) |",

          "content": "## Learning Objectives\r\nBy the end of this section, students will be able to:\r\n1. Calculate the range of a set of numbers\r\n2. Determine the median of a data set\r\n3. Find the lower and upper quartiles of a data set\r\n4. Interpret the range and quartiles in the context of real-world problems\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nStatistics play a crucial role in our daily lives, especially in a country like Ghana. Imagine you are at the market, and you want to compare the prices of different vendors selling the same product. By analyzing the range of prices, you can make an informed decision about which vendor offers the best deal. Similarly, when preparing for the BECE exams, understanding the range and quartiles of your practice scores can help you gauge your performance and identify areas for improvement.\r\n\r\nIn this section, we will explore the concepts of range and quartiles, which are essential tools in statistics. These concepts will not only help you in your mathematics exams but also in real-life situations, such as managing your mobile money transactions or estimating crop yields on a farm.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Range\r\nThe **range** of a set of numbers is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the set. It gives us an idea of how spread out the data is. To calculate the range, we use the following formula:\r\n\r\nRange = Maximum value - Minimum value\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have the following set of numbers representing the prices of a bag of rice (in GH₵) from different vendors at the market:\r\n\r\n{25, 30, 28, 32, 27}\r\n\r\nThe maximum value is 32, and the minimum value is 25. Therefore, the range is:\r\n\r\nRange = 32 - 25 = 7\r\n\r\nThis means that the prices of a bag of rice vary by GH₵7 among the different vendors.\r\n\r\n### Median\r\nThe **median** is the middle value in a sorted set of numbers. If the set has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value. If the set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\r\n\r\nTo find the median:\r\n1. Arrange the data in ascending or descending order\r\n2. If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle value\r\n3. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle values\r\n\r\nLet's find the median of the prices of a bag of rice from the previous example:\r\n\r\n{25, 27, 28, 30, 32}\r\n\r\nSince there are 5 values (an odd number), the median is the middle value, which is 28.\r\n\r\n### Quartiles\r\n**Quartiles** divide a sorted data set into four equal parts. There are three quartiles: the lower quartile (Q1), the median (Q2), and the upper quartile (Q3).\r\n\r\nTo find the quartiles:\r\n1. Arrange the data in ascending or descending order\r\n2. Find the median (Q2)\r\n3. The lower quartile (Q1) is the median of the lower half of the data\r\n4. The upper quartile (Q3) is the median of the upper half of the data\r\n\r\nLet's find the quartiles of the following set of BECE scores:\r\n\r\n{60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95}\r\n\r\nFirst, we find the median (Q2):\r\n- Median (Q2) = (75 + 80) ÷ 2 = 77.5\r\n\r\nNow, we find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3):\r\n- Lower quartile (Q1) = (65 + 70) ÷ 2 = 67.5\r\n- Upper quartile (Q3) = (85 + 90) ÷ 2 = 87.5\r\n\r\nThis means that:\r\n- 25% of the scores are less than or equal to 67.5\r\n- 50% of the scores are less than or equal to 77.5\r\n- 75% of the scores are less than or equal to 87.5\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. A farmer records the weights (in kg) of 7 randomly selected cocoa sacks: {58, 62, 60, 59, 63, 61, 60}. Calculate the range of the weights.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A sketch of 7 cocoa sacks with their weights labeled]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nFirst, let's arrange the weights in ascending order:\r\n{58, 59, 60, 60, 61, 62, 63}\r\n\r\nNow, we can find the minimum and maximum values:\r\n- Minimum value = 58\r\n- Maximum value = 63\r\n\r\nUsing the range formula:\r\nRange = Maximum value - Minimum value\r\nRange = 63 - 58 = 5\r\n\r\nTherefore, the range of the cocoa sack weights is 5 kg.\r\n\r\n2. The daily sales (in GH₵) at a mobile money shop for a week are: {520, 480, 550, 490, 530, 570, 500}. Find the median of the daily sales.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nFirst, let's arrange the sales in ascending order:\r\n{480, 490, 500, 520, 530, 550, 570}\r\n\r\nSince there are 7 values (an odd number), the median is the middle value (the 4th value):\r\nMedian = 520\r\n\r\nTherefore, the median of the daily sales is GH₵520.\r\n\r\n3. The distances (in km) traveled by a taxi driver each day for 8 days are: {120, 130, 110, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180}. Find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3) of the distances traveled.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A table showing the distances traveled by the taxi driver each day]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nFirst, let's arrange the distances in ascending order:\r\n{110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180}\r\n\r\nNow, we find the median (Q2):\r\nMedian (Q2) = (140 + 150) ÷ 2 = 145\r\n\r\nTo find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3):\r\n- Lower quartile (Q1) = (120 + 130) ÷ 2 = 125\r\n- Upper quartile (Q3) = (160 + 170) ÷ 2 = 165\r\n\r\nTherefore, the lower quartile (Q1) is 125 km, and the upper quartile (Q3) is 165 km.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. The ages of 9 students in a class are: {12, 13, 11, 14, 12, 13, 12, 11, 13}. Calculate the range of the ages.\r\n\r\n2. The scores of 10 students on a BECE practice test are: {80, 85, 90, 75, 95, 70, 85, 80, 90, 75}. Find the median score.\r\n\r\n3. The heights (in cm) of 12 plants in a garden are: {50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105}. Find the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3) of the plant heights.\r\n\r\nAnswers:\r\n1.

Understand the concept of probability and its relation to real-life events\r\n2. Express probability as a fraction, decimal, or percentage\r\n3. Identify the probability scale and its range from 0 to 1\r\n4. Solve problems involving probability scales and compare probabilities of different events\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nProbability is a crucial concept in mathematics that helps us understand the likelihood of events occurring in our daily lives. In Ghana, we encounter situations involving probability every day, from the chances of winning a game of ampe to the likelihood of a good harvest based on weather patterns. Understanding probability is also essential for making informed decisions, such as choosing the best mobile money provider based on their reliability and security.\r\n\r\nAs you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering probability will not only help you solve mathematical problems but also develop critical thinking skills that will serve you well in various aspects of life. In this section, we will explore the probability scale and learn how to express probability in different forms.\r\n\r\n### Main Content\r\n#### Understanding Probability\r\n**Probability** is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means an event is impossible, and 1 means an event is certain to happen. The closer the probability is to 1, the more likely the event is to occur.\r\n\r\n#### Expressing Probability\r\nProbability can be expressed in three forms:\r\n1. **Fraction**: The number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, if there are 4 red marbles and 6 blue marbles in a bag, the probability of picking a red marble is $\\frac{4}{10}$.\r\n2. **Decimal**: The probability expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1. In the previous example, the probability of picking a red marble is 0.4.\r\n3. **Percentage**: The probability expressed as a percentage between 0% and 100%. In the example, the probability of picking a red marble is 40%.\r\n\r\n#### The Probability Scale\r\nThe **probability scale** is a visual representation of the range of probabilities from 0 to 1. It helps us compare the likelihoods of different events.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A horizontal line with 0 on the left, 1 on the right, and evenly spaced marks in between. Label the scale \"Probability Scale\" and add labels \"Impossible\" at 0, \"Unlikely\" at 0.25, \"Equal chance\" at 0.5, \"Likely\" at 0.75, and \"Certain\" at 1.]\r\n\r\n#### Converting Between Probability Forms\r\nTo convert between probability forms, follow these steps:\r\n1. Fraction to decimal: Divide the numerator by the denominator.\r\n2. Decimal to percentage: Multiply the decimal by 100 and add the % symbol.\r\n3. Percentage to decimal: Divide the percentage by 100.\r\n4. Decimal to fraction: Write the decimal as a fraction over 100 and simplify if possible.\r\n\r\n| Conversion | Formula | Example |\r\n|------------|---------|---------|\r\n| Fraction to decimal | $\\frac{numerator}{denominator} = decimal$ | $\\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$ |\r\n| Decimal to percentage | $decimal \\times 100 = percentage\\%$ | $0.75 \\times 100 = 75\\%$ |\r\n| Percentage to decimal | $percentage\\% \\div 100 = decimal$ | $75\\% \\div 100 = 0.75$ |\r\n| Decimal to fraction | $decimal = \\frac{decimal \\times 100}{100}$ | $0.75 = \\frac{75}{100} = \\frac{3}{4}$ |\r\n\r\n### Worked Examples\r\n1. Kofi has a bag containing 3 red balls and 5 blue balls. What is the probability of randomly selecting a red ball from the bag?\r\n\r\n   Total number of balls = 3 (red) + 5 (blue) = 8\r\n   Probability of selecting a red ball = $\\frac{3}{8}$ = 0.375 = 37.5%\r\n\r\n2. Ama spins a spinner with 4 equal sections colored yellow, green, blue, and red. What is the probability of the spinner landing on green?\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: A circular spinner divided into 4 equal parts, labeled yellow, green, blue, and red.]\r\n\r\n   Total number of sections = 4\r\n   Probability of landing on green = $\\frac{1}{4}$ = 0.25 = 25%\r\n\r\n3. In a class of 30 students, 18 prefer football, and the rest prefer basketball. Express the probability of randomly selecting a student who prefers basketball as a fraction, decimal, and percentage.\r\n\r\n   Number of students who prefer basketball = 30 - 18 = 12\r\n   Probability of selecting a student who prefers basketball:\r\n   - Fraction: $\\frac{12}{30} = \\frac{2}{5}$\r\n   - Decimal: $\\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$\r\n   - Percentage: $0.4 \\times 100 = 40\\%$\r\n\r\n### Practice Problems\r\n1. A die is rolled. What is the probability of getting an even number?\r\n2. In a bag of 20 marbles, 7 are red, 6 are blue, and 7 are green. If a marble is randomly selected, what is the probability of picking a blue marble? Express your answer as a fraction and a percentage.\r\n3. Kwame has a deck of 52 cards. He draws a card at random.

Solve real-life problems involving simple probability\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nProbability is a crucial concept in mathematics that helps us understand the likelihood of events occurring in our daily lives. From deciding whether to carry an umbrella based on the chance of rain to calculating the odds of winning a game of ampe, probability is all around us. In Ghana, understanding probability is essential for making informed decisions in various aspects of life, such as managing finances, planning agricultural activities, and even preparing for the BECE exams. By mastering the concepts of simple probability, students can develop critical thinking skills and apply mathematical reasoning to real-world situations.\r\n\r\nImagine you are selling fruits at the market, and you have a basket containing 20 oranges, 15 bananas, and 10 mangoes. If a customer randomly selects a fruit from the basket, what is the probability that they will choose a banana? By applying the principles of simple probability, you can quickly determine the likelihood of this event occurring. This knowledge can help you make better decisions in your daily life and prepare you for success in your academic journey, especially as you approach the BECE exams.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Basic Principles of Probability\r\nProbability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event is impossible, and 1 means the event is certain to happen. The probability of an event A is denoted as P(A).\r\n\r\n### Calculating Simple Probability\r\nTo calculate the probability of a simple event, we use the following formula:\r\n\r\nP(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes)/(Total number of possible outcomes)\r\n\r\nFor example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, the probability of getting a 4 is:\r\n\r\nP(rolling a 4) = (Number of ways to get a 4)/(Total number of possible outcomes) = 1/6\r\n\r\n### Complement Rule\r\nThe complement of an event A, denoted as A', is the event that occurs when A does not occur. The probability of the complement of an event A is given by:\r\n\r\nP(A') = 1 - P(A)\r\n\r\nFor instance, if the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of 52 cards is 1/2, then the probability of not drawing a red card (i.e., drawing a black card) is:\r\n\r\nP(not drawing a red card) = 1 - P(drawing a red card) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\r\n\r\n### Applying Simple Probability to Real-Life Situations\r\nSimple probability can be applied to various real-life situations in Ghana. For example, let's consider a farmer who has a herd of 50 cattle, consisting of 30 cows and 20 bulls. If the farmer randomly selects one animal to sell at the market, what is the probability that the selected animal is a cow?\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram showing a herd of cattle with 30 cows and 20 bulls]\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we can use the simple probability formula:\r\n\r\nP(selecting a cow) = (Number of cows)/(Total number of cattle) = 30/50 = 3/5\r\n\r\nTherefore, the probability of selecting a cow from the herd is 3/5 or 60%.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. In a bag containing 12 balls, there are 4 red balls, 5 blue balls, and 3 green balls. If a ball is randomly drawn from the bag, what is the probability that it is blue?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nTotal number of balls = 4 + 5 + 3 = 12\r\nNumber of blue balls = 5\r\nP(drawing a blue ball) = (Number of blue balls)/(Total number of balls) = 5/12\r\n\r\n2. A spinner has 8 equal sections, numbered 1 to 8. If the spinner is spun once, what is the probability of getting an even number?\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram of a spinner with 8 equal sections, numbered 1 to 8]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nTotal number of possible outcomes = 8\r\nNumber of favorable outcomes (even numbers) = 4 (2, 4, 6, 8)\r\nP(getting an even number) = (Number of even numbers)/(Total number of possible outcomes) = 4/8 = 1/2\r\n\r\n3. In a class of 30 students, 18 are girls, and 12 are boys. If a student is randomly selected to answer a question, what is the probability that the student is a boy?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nTotal number of students = 18 + 12 = 30\r\nNumber of boys = 12\r\nP(selecting a boy) = (Number of boys)/(Total number of students) = 12/30 = 2/5\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. A die is rolled once. What is the probability of getting a number less than 4?\r\n2. In a basket of 20 fruits, there are 8 apples, 7 oranges, and 5 pears. If a fruit is randomly selected, what is the probability that it is not an apple?\r\n3. A card is drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards. What is the probability of drawing a heart?\r\n\r\n(Answers: 1. 1/2; 2. 3/5; 3. 1/4)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- Probability is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.\r\n- The probability of a simple event A is calculated using the formula: P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes)/(Total number of possible outcomes).\r\n- The complement of an event A, denoted as A', is the event that occurs when A does not occur. The probability of the complement is given by: P(A') = 1 - P(A).\r\n- Simple probability can be applied to various real-life situations, such as farming, market transactions, and games.\r\n- When solving simple probability problems, it is essential to identify the total number of possible outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n| Term/Formula | Meaning/Use |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| Probability | A measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1 |\r\n| Simple event | An event with a single outcome |\r\n| P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes)/(Total number of possible outcomes) | Formula for calculating the probability of a simple event A |\r\n| Complement | The event that occurs when a given event does not occur |\r\n| P(A') = 1 - P(A) | Formula for calculating the probability of the complement of an event A |",

Solve real-life problems involving combined events and their probabilities\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we often encounter situations where we need to calculate the likelihood of multiple events occurring together or separately. For example, a market trader in Kumasi may want to know the probability of selling both plantains and yams on a given day, or a student preparing for the BECE exam might be interested in the chances of passing both the Mathematics and English papers. Understanding how to calculate the probabilities of combined events is crucial for making informed decisions and solving real-world problems.\r\n\r\nIn this section, we will explore the concept of combined events and learn how to calculate their probabilities using the addition and multiplication rules. By mastering these techniques, you will be well-equipped to tackle various probability questions in the BECE exam and apply your knowledge to everyday situations involving chance and uncertainty.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Union of Two Events (Addition Rule)\r\nThe **union** of two events, denoted as A ∪ B, is the event that occurs when either event A or event B (or both) happens. The probability of the union of two events A and B is given by the addition rule:\r\n\r\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\r\n\r\nwhere P(A ∩ B) is the probability of the intersection of events A and B (the event that both A and B occur simultaneously).\r\n\r\nIf events A and B are **mutually exclusive** (they cannot occur at the same time), then P(A ∩ B) = 0, and the addition rule simplifies to:\r\n\r\nP(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)\r\n\r\n| Property | Formula |\r\n|----------|---------|\r\n| Union of Two Events | P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) |\r\n| Union of Mutually Exclusive Events | P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) |\r\n\r\n### Intersection of Two Events (Multiplication Rule)\r\nThe **intersection** of two events, denoted as A ∩ B, is the event that occurs when both event A and event B happen simultaneously. The probability of the intersection of two events A and B is given by the multiplication rule:\r\n\r\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)\r\n\r\nwhere P(B|A) is the **conditional probability** of event B occurring given that event A has already occurred.\r\n\r\nIf events A and B are **independent** (the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event), then P(B|A) = P(B), and the multiplication rule simplifies to:\r\n\r\nP(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)\r\n\r\n| Property | Formula |\r\n|----------|---------|\r\n| Intersection of Two Events | P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B\\|A) |\r\n| Intersection of Independent Events | P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) |\r\n\r\n### Venn Diagrams and Combined Events\r\nVenn diagrams are a useful tool for visualizing the relationships between events and calculating probabilities of combined events.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A Venn diagram showing the union and intersection of two events A and B, with the sample space S represented by a rectangle and events A and B represented by overlapping circles. Label the regions corresponding to P(A), P(B), P(A ∩ B), and P(A ∪ B).]\r\n\r\nTo calculate the probability of the union or intersection of events using a Venn diagram:\r\n1. Identify the regions corresponding to the individual events and their intersection.\r\n2. Add the probabilities of the relevant regions, taking care not to double-count the intersection if applicable.\r\n\r\n### Solving Combined Event Problems\r\nWhen solving problems involving combined events, follow these steps:\r\n1. Identify the events and determine whether they are independent, mutually exclusive, or overlapping.\r\n2. Choose the appropriate rule (addition or multiplication) based on the relationship between the events.\r\n3. Calculate the probabilities of the individual events and their intersection (if required).\r\n4. Substitute the values into the relevant formula and simplify to obtain the final probability.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Kofi, a mobile money agent in Accra, has a 60% chance of completing a transaction successfully on the first attempt and a 50% chance of completing it on the second attempt. What is the probability that Kofi will complete the transaction successfully on either the first or second attempt?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Let A be the event of completing the transaction on the first attempt, and B be the event of completing it on the second attempt.\r\n- P(A) = 0.60 and P(B) = 0.50\r\n- Since the attempts are independent, we can use the addition rule for the union of two events:\r\n  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\r\n- P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) (multiplication rule for independent events)\r\n  P(A ∩ B) = 0.60 × 0.50 = 0.30\r\n- Substitute the values into the addition rule:\r\n  P(A ∪ B) = 0.60 + 0.50 - 0.30 = 0.80\r\nTherefore, the probability that Kofi will complete the transaction successfully on either the first or second attempt is 0.80 or 80%.\r\n\r\n2. A bag contains 4 red balls and 6 blue balls. If two balls are drawn at random without replacement, what is the probability of drawing a red ball and then a blue ball?\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A bag containing 4 red balls and 6 blue balls, with two balls being drawn sequentially without replacement.]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Let A be the event of drawing a red ball on the first draw, and B be the event of drawing a blue ball on the second draw.\r\n- P(A) = 4/10 = 2/5 (there are 4 red balls out of a total of 10 balls)\r\n- P(B|A) = 6/9 = 2/3 (after drawing a red ball, there are 6 blue balls out of the remaining 9 balls)\r\n- Using the multiplication rule for dependent events:\r\n  P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)\r\n  P(A ∩ B) = (2/5) × (2/3) = 4/15\r\nTherefore, the probability of drawing a red ball and then a blue ball is 4/15.\r\n\r\n3. In a village near Tamale, the probability of a farmer growing maize is 0.75, and the probability of growing yams is 0.60. If the probability of growing both maize and yams is 0.50, what is the probability that a farmer grows either maize or yams?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Let A be the event of growing maize, and B be the event of growing yams.\r\n- P(A) = 0.75, P(B) = 0.60, and P(A ∩ B) = 0.50\r\n- Using the addition rule for the union of two events:\r\n  P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)\r\n  P(A ∪ B) = 0.75 + 0.60 - 0.50 = 0.85\r\nTherefore, the probability that a farmer grows either maize or yams is 0.85 or 85%.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1.

A bag contains 3 red marbles, 4 blue marbles, and 5 green marbles. If two marbles are drawn at random with replacement, what is the probability of drawing a red marble and then a blue marble? (Answer: 1/6)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- The union of two events A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is the event that occurs when either A or B (or both) happens. The probability of the union is given by the addition rule: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B).\r\n- The intersection of two events A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is the event that occurs when both A and B happen simultaneously. The probability of the intersection is given by the multiplication rule: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A).\r\n- If events A and B are mutually exclusive, then P(A ∩ B) = 0, and the addition rule simplifies to P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B).\r\n- If events A and B are independent, then P(B|A) = P(B), and the multiplication rule simplifies to P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B).\r\n- Venn diagrams can be used to visualize the relationships between events and calculate probabilities of combined events.\r\n- When solving problems involving combined events, identify the events, determine their relationship, choose the appropriate rule, calculate the probabilities, and substitute the values into the relevant formula.\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n| Term/Formula | Meaning/Use |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| Union (A ∪ B) | The event that occurs when either event A or event B (or both) happens |\r\n| Intersection (A ∩ B) | The event that occurs when both event A and event B happen simultaneously |\r\n| Addition Rule | P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) |\r\n| Multiplication Rule | P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B\\|A) |\r\n| Mutually Exclusive Events | Events that cannot occur at the same time; P(A ∩ B) = 0 |\r\n| Independent Events | Events where the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other; P(B\\|A) = P(B) |\r\n| Conditional Probability (P(B\\|A)) | The probability of event B occurring given that event A has already occurred |",
