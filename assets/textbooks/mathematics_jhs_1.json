Understand the concept of place value in whole numbers.\r\n2. Read and write whole numbers up to billions.\r\n3. Compare and order whole numbers using place value.\r\n4. Round whole numbers to the nearest tens, hundreds, thousands, or millions.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nMathematics plays a crucial role in our daily lives, and understanding whole numbers is essential for Ghanaian students. Imagine you're at the market, and you need to calculate the total cost of your purchases. Or perhaps you're helping your family on the farm, and you need to measure the area of a field. In both cases, you'll be working with whole numbers. As you prepare for the BECE exam, mastering whole numbers and place value will give you a strong foundation for success in mathematics.\r\n\r\nIn this section, we'll explore the world of whole numbers and place value. We'll learn how to read and write large numbers, compare and order them, and round them to different place values. These skills will help you in various aspects of your life, from managing your mobile money account to excelling in your future career.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Understanding Place Value\r\nIn the decimal number system, each digit in a number has a specific place value. The place value of a digit depends on its position in the number. For example, in the number 5,678, the place values are as follows:\r\n\r\n| Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |\r\n|-----------|----------|------|------|\r\n| 5         | 6        | 7    | 8    |\r\n\r\nThe value of each digit is determined by multiplying the digit by its place value. For instance, in the number 5,678:\r\n- 5 is in the thousands place, so its value is 5 × 1,000 = 5,000\r\n- 6 is in the hundreds place, so its value is 6 × 100 = 600\r\n- 7 is in the tens place, so its value is 7 × 10 = 70\r\n- 8 is in the ones place, so its value is 8 × 1 = 8\r\n\r\nThe sum of these values gives us the total value of the number: 5,000 + 600 + 70 + 8 = 5,678.\r\n\r\n### Reading and Writing Whole Numbers\r\nWhole numbers can be read and written using place value. Here's a table showing the place values up to billions:\r\n\r\n| Billions | Hundred Millions | Ten Millions | Millions | Hundred Thousands | Ten Thousands | Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |\r\n|----------|------------------|--------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|------|------|\r\n\r\nTo read a whole number, start from the left and read each group of three digits as hundreds, tens, and ones, followed by the place value name. For example, the number 123,456,789 is read as \"one hundred twenty-three million, four hundred fifty-six thousand, seven hundred eighty-nine.\"\r\n\r\nTo write a whole number in words, start from the left and write each group of three digits as hundreds, tens, and ones, followed by the place value name. Use commas to separate each group of three digits. For example, \"two billion, five hundred eighty-seven million, three hundred forty-one thousand, six hundred twenty-five\" is written as 2,587,341,625.\r\n\r\n### Comparing and Ordering Whole Numbers\r\nTo compare two whole numbers, start from the leftmost digit and compare the digits in each place value. If the digits in the leftmost place value are different, the number with the greater digit in that place value is the greater number. If the digits in the leftmost place value are the same, move to the next place value and repeat the process until you find a difference or reach the end of the numbers.\r\n\r\nFor example, to compare 3,452 and 3,427:\r\n- Both numbers have the same digit in the thousands place (3).\r\n- In the hundreds place, 3,452 has a greater digit (4) than 3,427 (4 > 2).\r\n- Therefore, 3,452 > 3,427.\r\n\r\nTo order a set of whole numbers, compare the numbers two at a time using the method described above. Arrange the numbers in ascending (smallest to largest) or descending (largest to smallest) order.\r\n\r\n### Rounding Whole Numbers\r\nRounding a whole number means finding the nearest value at a specific place value. To round a number to a particular place value, follow these steps:\r\n1. Identify the digit in the place value you want to round to.\r\n2. Look at the digit to the right of the identified digit.\r\n   - If the digit to the right is 5 or greater, add 1 to the identified digit.\r\n   - If the digit to the right is less than 5, keep the identified digit as it is.\r\n3. Replace all the digits to the right of the identified digit with zeros.\r\n\r\nFor example, to round 7,841 to the nearest thousand:\r\n1. The digit in the thousands place is 7.\r\n2. The digit to the right of 7 is 8, which is greater than 5.\r\n3. Add 1 to 7, making it 8, and replace all digits to the right with zeros.\r\n4. The result is 8,000.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A number line showing the rounding of 7,841 to the nearest thousand. The number line should have labels for 7,000 and 8,000, with 7,841 positioned between them and an arrow pointing to 8,000.]\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Write the number 4,567,890,123 in words.\r\n   \r\n   Solution:\r\n   \"Four billion, five hundred sixty-seven million, eight hundred ninety thousand, one hundred twenty-three\"\r\n\r\n2. Compare the numbers 23,451 and 23,415.\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   - Both numbers have the same digits in the ten thousands and thousands places (2 and 3).\r\n   - In the hundreds place, 23,451 has a greater digit (4) than 23,415 (4 > 1).\r\n   - Therefore, 23,451 > 23,415.\r\n\r\n3. Round 56,782 to the nearest hundred.\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   1. The digit in the hundreds place is 7.\r\n   2. The digit to the right of 7 is 8, which is greater than 5.\r\n   3. Add 1 to 7, making it 8, and replace all digits to the right with zeros.\r\n   4. The result is 56,800.\r\n\r\n4. Kofi has GH₵1,254,890 in his mobile money account. He wants to withdraw some money to buy a new tractor for his farm. The tractor costs GH₵985,000. How much money will Kofi have left in his account after buying the tractor?\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   - Kofi's current account balance: GH₵1,254,890\r\n   - Tractor cost: GH₵985,000\r\n   - To find the remaining balance, subtract the tractor cost from Kofi's current balance:\r\n     1,254,890 - 985,000 = 269,890\r\n   - Therefore, Kofi will have GH₵269,890 left in his account after buying the tractor.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. Write the number 9,045,312,678 in words.\r\n2. Compare the numbers 78,123 and 78,213.\r\n3. Round 1,345,678 to the nearest million.\r\n4. Ama sells tomatoes at the market. She has 12,500 tomatoes in stock. If she sells 8,743 tomatoes in one day, how many tomatoes does she have left?\r\n\r\nAnswers:\r\n1. \"Nine billion, forty-five million, three hundred twelve thousand, six hundred seventy-eight\"\r\n2. 78,123 < 78,213\r\n3. 1,000,000\r\n4. 3,757 tomatoes\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- In the decimal number system, each digit in a number has a specific place value based on its position.\r\n- Whole numbers can be read and written using place value.\r\n- To compare two whole numbers, start from the leftmost digit and compare the digits in each place value.\r\n- To order a set of whole numbers, compare the numbers two at a time and arrange them in ascending or descending order.\r\n- Rounding a whole number means finding the nearest value at a specific place value.\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n| Term/Formula | Meaning/Use |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| Place Value | The value of a digit based on its position in a number |\r\n| Whole Numbers | The set of non-negative integers: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... |\r\n| Rounding | Finding the nearest value at a specific place value |",

Convert between fractions and decimals\r\n2. Compare and order fractions and decimals\r\n3. Perform addition and subtraction with fractions and decimals\r\n4. Solve real-world problems involving fractions and decimals\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nFractions and decimals are essential concepts in mathematics that have many applications in our daily lives. In Ghana, we use fractions and decimals when dealing with money, measurements, and even in preparing our favorite dishes. For example, when you go to the market to buy ingredients for your favorite stew, you might need to purchase half a kilogram of meat or a quarter of a liter of palm oil. Understanding fractions and decimals is also crucial for managing your mobile money account and making sure you receive the correct change when buying items. As you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering fractions and decimals will help you solve problems quickly and accurately, giving you an advantage in the exam hall.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Converting between Fractions and Decimals\r\nTo convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, to convert $\\frac{3}{4}$ to a decimal, divide 3 by 4:\r\n\r\n$\\frac{3}{4} = 3 \\div 4 = 0.75$\r\n\r\nTo convert a decimal to a fraction, write the decimal as a fraction with a denominator of a power of 10, then simplify if necessary. For example, to convert 0.6 to a fraction:\r\n\r\n$0.6 = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$\r\n\r\n### Comparing and Ordering Fractions and Decimals\r\nTo compare fractions with the same denominator, compare the numerators. The fraction with the larger numerator is greater. For example, $\\frac{3}{5} > \\frac{2}{5}$ because 3 > 2.\r\n\r\nTo compare fractions with different denominators, convert them to decimals or find a common denominator. For example, to compare $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$:\r\n\r\n$\\frac{2}{3} = 0.666...$ and $\\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$, so $\\frac{3}{4} > \\frac{2}{3}$\r\n\r\nTo compare decimals, compare the digits from left to right. The decimal with the greater value in the first differing digit is greater. For example, 0.78 > 0.65 because 7 > 6.\r\n\r\n### Adding and Subtracting Fractions and Decimals\r\nTo add or subtract fractions with the same denominator, add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator the same. For example:\r\n\r\n$\\frac{2}{7} + \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{5}{7}$\r\n\r\nTo add or subtract fractions with different denominators, find a common denominator first. For example:\r\n\r\n$\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4}{12} - \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{1}{12}$\r\n\r\nTo add or subtract decimals, line up the decimal points and add or subtract as if they were whole numbers. For example:\r\n\r\n$1.23 + 4.56 = 5.79$\r\n\r\n### Solving Real-World Problems\r\nTo solve real-world problems involving fractions and decimals, follow these steps:\r\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the question being asked.\r\n2. Convert fractions and decimals to the same representation if necessary.\r\n3. Perform the required operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).\r\n4. Interpret the result in the context of the problem and write your answer with the appropriate unit.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Kofi has a rope that is $2\\frac{1}{4}$ meters long. He cuts off $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a meter to tie a package. How much rope does Kofi have left?\r\n[IMAGE: A rope with a section cut off]\r\n\r\nStep 1: Identify the given information and the question.\r\n- Kofi's rope is $2\\frac{1}{4}$ meters long.\r\n- He cuts off $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a meter.\r\n- We need to find the remaining length of the rope.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction.\r\n$2\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{9}{4}$\r\n\r\nStep 3: Subtract the cut portion from the original length.\r\n$\\frac{9}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{6}{4}$\r\n\r\nStep 4: Simplify the result and write the answer with the appropriate unit.\r\n$\\frac{6}{4} = 1\\frac{1}{2}$ meters\r\n\r\nTherefore, Kofi has $1\\frac{1}{2}$ meters of rope left.\r\n\r\n2. Ama bought 2.5 kg of rice and 1.75 kg of beans. What is the total weight of her purchase?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Identify the given information and the question.\r\n- Ama bought 2.5 kg of rice and 1.75 kg of beans.\r\n- We need to find the total weight of her purchase.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Add the weights of the rice and beans.\r\n$2.5 + 1.75 = 4.25$\r\n\r\nStep 3: Write the answer with the appropriate unit.\r\nAma's total purchase weight is 4.25 kg.\r\n\r\n3.

Convert between percentages, decimals, and fractions\r\n2. Calculate percentages of quantities\r\n3. Solve percentage increase and decrease problems\r\n4. Apply percentages to real-life situations (e.g., discounts, taxes, interest)\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nPercentages are an essential part of our daily lives in Ghana. When you go to the market to buy groceries, you might find a seller offering a 10% discount on yams. If you use mobile money to send funds to your family, the service provider may charge a 1% transaction fee. When farmers harvest their crops, they need to calculate the percentage of the yield that goes to different purposes, such as selling, storing, and planting for the next season. Understanding percentages is also crucial for your success in the BECE examination, as they are a common topic in the mathematics section. In this lesson, we will explore how to work with percentages and apply them to real-life situations.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Converting between percentages, decimals, and fractions\r\nA percentage is a fraction with a denominator of 100. To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide the percentage by 100. To convert a decimal to a percentage, multiply the decimal by 100 and add the % symbol.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram showing the conversion between 25%, 0.25, and 1/4]\r\n\r\nTo convert between fractions and percentages, first convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator, then multiply by 100 and add the % symbol.\r\n\r\n### Calculating percentages of quantities\r\nTo find the percentage of a quantity, multiply the quantity by the percentage expressed as a decimal.\r\n\r\nFormula: **Percentage of quantity = Quantity × (Percentage ÷ 100)**\r\n\r\nFor example, to calculate 15% of 80:\r\n* 15% ÷ 100 = 0.15\r\n* 80 × 0.15 = 12\r\n\r\nSo, 15% of 80 is 12.\r\n\r\n### Percentage increase and decrease\r\nTo calculate a percentage increase or decrease, use the following formulas:\r\n\r\n| Concept | Formula |\r\n|---------|---------|\r\n| Percentage increase | **Increase = Original value × (1 + Percentage increase ÷ 100)** |\r\n| Percentage decrease | **Decrease = Original value × (1 - Percentage decrease ÷ 100)** |\r\n\r\nFor example, if a bag of rice that originally cost GH₵50 increases in price by 20%, the new price would be:\r\n* Increase = 50 × (1 + 20 ÷ 100)\r\n* Increase = 50 × 1.2 = GH₵60\r\n\r\n### Applying percentages to real-life situations\r\nPercentages are used in various real-life situations, such as:\r\n- Discounts: A 15% discount on a GH₵100 item means you pay GH₵85.\r\n- Taxes: If the VAT is 12.5%, an item with a pre-tax price of GH₵80 will cost GH₵90 (80 × 1.125).\r\n- Interest: If your savings account earns 5% annual interest, a balance of GH₵1,000 will grow to GH₵1,050 after one year (1,000 × 1.05).\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Kofi wants to buy a new phone that costs GH₵600. The store offers a 20% discount. How much will Kofi pay for the phone?\r\n   * Discount = 600 × (20 ÷ 100) = GH₵120\r\n   * Price after discount = 600 - 120 = GH₵480\r\n   So, Kofi will pay GH₵480 for the phone.\r\n\r\n2. Ama sold 250 kilograms of maize. She kept 15% for her family's consumption and sold the rest. How many kilograms of maize did Ama sell?\r\n   * Maize kept = 250 × (15 ÷ 100) = 37.5 kg\r\n   * Maize sold = 250 - 37.5 = 212.5 kg\r\n   Therefore, Ama sold 212.5 kilograms of maize.\r\n\r\n3. Kwame borrowed GH₵2,000 from a bank with a 10% annual interest rate. How much will he need to pay back after one year?\r\n   * Interest = 2,000 × (10 ÷ 100) = GH₵200\r\n   * Total payback = 2,000 + 200 = GH₵2,200\r\n   Kwame will need to pay back GH₵2,200 after one year.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. Convert 3/5 to a percentage.\r\n2. A store offers a 25% discount on a dress originally priced at GH₵120. What is the discounted price?\r\n3. Yaw's salary increased by 12% from GH₵1,500. What is his new salary?\r\n\r\nAnswers:\r\n1. 60%\r\n2. GH₵90\r\n3. GH₵1,680\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- Percentages can be converted to decimals by dividing by 100, and to fractions by first converting to decimals.\r\n- To find the percentage of a quantity, multiply the quantity by the percentage expressed as a decimal.\r\n- Percentage increase: Increase = Original value × (1 + Percentage increase ÷ 100)\r\n- Percentage decrease: Decrease = Original value × (1 - Percentage decrease ÷ 100)\r\n- Percentages are used in real-life situations like discounts, taxes, and interest.\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n\r\n| Term/Formula | Meaning/Use |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| Percentage   | A fraction with a denominator of 100 |\r\n| Percentage of quantity | Quantity × (Percentage ÷ 100) |\r\n| Percentage increase | Original value × (1 + Percentage increase ÷ 100) |\r\n| Percentage decrease | Original value × (1 - Percentage decrease ÷ 100) |",

          "content": "# Chapter 1: Number and Numeration\r\n## Section: Ratio and Proportion\r\n\r\n## Learning Objectives\r\nAfter studying this section, students will be able to:\r\n1. Understand the concept of ratio and express ratios in simplest form.\r\n2. Solve problems involving ratios and sharing in a given ratio.\r\n3. Understand the concept of proportion and solve problems involving direct and inverse proportion.\r\n4. Apply the unitary method to solve real-life problems involving ratio and proportion.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nRatio and proportion are essential mathematical concepts that have numerous applications in everyday life. In Ghana, we use these concepts in various situations, such as:\r\n- Calculating the price of items in the market based on the quantity purchased.\r\n- Exchanging Ghana cedis for other currencies or using mobile money services.\r\n- Determining the amount of fertilizer needed for a farm based on its size.\r\n- Solving problems in the WAEC/BECE exams that involve comparing quantities or sharing resources.\r\n\r\nBy mastering the concepts of ratio and proportion, students will be well-prepared to tackle real-life challenges and excel in their academic pursuits.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### What is a Ratio?\r\nA **ratio** is a way of comparing two or more quantities. It is written as a fraction, with the quantities separated by a colon (:). For example, if Kofi has 3 balls and Ama has 6 balls, the ratio of Kofi's balls to Ama's balls is 3:6, which can be simplified to 1:2.\r\n\r\nTo simplify a ratio, divide all quantities by their highest common factor (HCF). For instance, the ratio 12:18 can be simplified to 2:3 by dividing both numbers by their HCF, which is 6.\r\n\r\n### Sharing in a Given Ratio\r\nWhen sharing a quantity in a given ratio, divide the total quantity by the sum of the ratio parts, then multiply the result by each part of the ratio.\r\n\r\nFor example, if GH₵120 is to be shared between Adwoa and Kwesi in the ratio 2:3, follow these steps:\r\n1. Add the ratio parts: 2 + 3 = 5\r\n2. Divide the total amount by the sum of the ratio parts: GH₵120 ÷ 5 = GH₵24\r\n3. Multiply the result by each part of the ratio:\r\n   - Adwoa's share = 2 × GH₵24 = GH₵48\r\n   - Kwesi's share = 3 × GH₵24 = GH₵72\r\n\r\n### What is Proportion?\r\nA **proportion** is an equation stating that two ratios are equal. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar, and you want to use 6 cups of flour, the proportion would be:\r\n$$\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{6}{x}$$\r\nwhere $x$ represents the number of cups of sugar needed.\r\n\r\n### Solving Problems with Direct and Inverse Proportion\r\nIn **direct proportion**, as one quantity increases, the other quantity increases proportionally. For example, the cost of goods is directly proportional to the quantity purchased.\r\n\r\n| Quantity (kg) | Cost (GH₵) |\r\n|---------------|------------|\r\n| 1             | 4          |\r\n| 2             | 8          |\r\n| 3             | 12         |\r\n\r\nIn **inverse proportion**, as one quantity increases, the other quantity decreases proportionally. For example, the time taken to travel a fixed distance is inversely proportional to the speed.\r\n\r\n| Speed (km/h) | Time (hours) |\r\n|--------------|--------------|\r\n| 20           | 6            |\r\n| 40           | 3            |\r\n| 60           | 2            |\r\n\r\nTo solve problems involving direct or inverse proportion, use the unitary method:\r\n1. Find the value of one unit of the given quantity.\r\n2. Multiply the value of one unit by the required quantity.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. A map has a scale of 1:50,000. If the distance between two towns on the map is 8 cm, find the actual distance between the towns in kilometers.\r\n   \r\n   [IMAGE: A line segment labeled \"8 cm\" representing the distance between two points on a map.]\r\n   \r\n   Solution:\r\n   * Scale = 1:50,000\r\n   * Map distance = 8 cm\r\n   * Actual distance = Map distance × Scale\r\n   * Actual distance = 8 cm × 50,000 = 400,000 cm\r\n   * Convert cm to km: 400,000 cm ÷ 100,000 = 4 km\r\n   \r\n   Therefore, the actual distance between the towns is 4 km.\r\n\r\n2. A tap can fill a tank in 6 hours. If the tap is opened for only 2 hours, what fraction of the tank will be filled?\r\n   \r\n   Solution:\r\n   * Time to fill the tank = 6 hours\r\n   * Time the tap is open = 2 hours\r\n   * Fraction of the tank filled = Time the tap is open ÷ Time to fill the tank\r\n   * Fraction of the tank filled = 2 hours ÷ 6 hours = $\\frac{1}{3}$\r\n   \r\n   Therefore, $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the tank will be filled.\r\n\r\n3. Afia and Kwame shared GH₵480 in the ratio 5:3. How much money did each person receive?\r\n   \r\n   Solution:\r\n   * Total amount = GH₵480\r\n   * Ratio = 5:3\r\n   * Sum of ratio parts = 5 + 3 = 8\r\n   * Value of one part = GH₵480 ÷ 8 = GH₵60\r\n   * Afia's share = 5 × GH₵60 = GH₵300\r\n   * Kwame's share = 3 × GH₵60 = GH₵180\r\n   \r\n   Therefore, Afia received GH₵300 and Kwame received GH₵180.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. Express the ratio 54:72 in its simplest form.\r\n2. Share 60 kg of rice among Esi, Kojo, and Yaw in the ratio 2:3:5.\r\n3. If 15 workers can complete a project in 12 days, how long will it take 20 workers to complete the same project? (Assume the workers work at the same rate.)\r\n4. A car travels 240 km in 3 hours. How far will it travel in 5 hours at the same speed?\r\n\r\n(Answers: 1. 3:4; 2. Esi: 12 kg, Kojo: 18 kg, Yaw: 30 kg; 3. 9 days; 4. 400 km)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- A ratio compares two or more quantities and is written as a fraction with the quantities separated by a colon.\r\n- To simplify a ratio, divide all quantities by their highest common factor.\r\n- When sharing a quantity in a given ratio, divide the total quantity by the sum of the ratio parts, then multiply the result by each part of the ratio.\r\n- A proportion is an equation stating that two ratios are equal.\r\n- In direct proportion, as one quantity increases, the other quantity increases proportionally.

Understand and apply the commutative, associative, and distributive properties of numbers.\r\n4. Solve real-life problems involving whole numbers and multiple operations.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nMathematics is an essential part of our daily lives in Ghana. From calculating change at the market to measuring ingredients for a favorite dish, we use math every day. Understanding number operations is crucial for managing money, such as counting Ghana cedis or using mobile money services. Farmers need to perform calculations to determine the area of their land and the amount of fertilizer needed. As you prepare for the BECE exam, mastering these skills will help you succeed academically and in your future career.\r\n\r\nIn this section, we will explore the four basic number operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We will also learn about the order of operations and properties that help us solve problems efficiently. By the end of this section, you will have a strong foundation in number operations and be able to apply these skills to real-life situations.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Addition and Subtraction\r\nAddition and subtraction are the most basic number operations. Addition combines two or more numbers to find the total, while subtraction finds the difference between two numbers. The symbols for addition and subtraction are **+** and **-**, respectively.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n- Addition: 24 + 13 = 37\r\n- Subtraction: 42 - 19 = 23\r\n\r\nProperties of Addition:\r\n| Property | Example |\r\n|----------|---------|\r\n| Commutative | a + b = b + a |\r\n| Associative | (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) |\r\n\r\n### Multiplication and Division\r\nMultiplication is repeated addition, while division is the inverse of multiplication. The symbols for multiplication and division are **×** (or **·**) and **÷**, respectively. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n- Multiplication: 6 × 7 = 42\r\n- Division: 56 ÷ 8 = 7\r\n\r\nProperties of Multiplication:\r\n| Property | Example |\r\n|----------|---------|\r\n| Commutative | a × b = b × a |\r\n| Associative | (a × b) × c = a × (b × c) |\r\n| Distributive | a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c) |\r\n\r\n### Order of Operations (PEMDAS)\r\nWhen an expression involves multiple operations, we use the order of operations (PEMDAS) to determine the sequence in which to perform the operations.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating the order of operations with examples]\r\n\r\n1. **P**arentheses\r\n2. **E**xponents\r\n3. **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (left to right)\r\n4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nEvaluate: 24 + (6 - 2) × 3²\r\nStep 1: Parentheses: 24 + (4) × 3²\r\nStep 2: Exponents: 24 + 4 × 9\r\nStep 3: Multiplication: 24 + 36\r\nStep 4: Addition: 60\r\n\r\n### Solving Real-Life Problems\r\nTo solve real-life problems involving number operations, follow these steps:\r\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the question being asked.\r\n2. Determine the operation(s) needed to solve the problem.\r\n3. Write an equation or expression representing the problem.\r\n4. Solve the equation or evaluate the expression using the order of operations.\r\n5. Check your answer to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nKofi has GH₵75 in his mobile money account. He receives GH₵120 from his aunt and spends GH₵68 on a new textbook. How much money does Kofi have left in his account?\r\n\r\nStep 1: Given information:\r\n- Initial balance: GH₵75\r\n- Money received: GH₵120\r\n- Money spent: GH₵68\r\n\r\nStep 2: Operations needed: Addition and subtraction\r\n\r\nStep 3: Equation: Final balance = Initial balance + Money received - Money spent\r\n\r\nStep 4: Solve: Final balance = 75 + 120 - 68 = 127\r\n\r\nStep 5: Check: The final balance of GH₵127 makes sense, as Kofi had more money added to his account than he spent.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Kofi has GH₵127 left in his mobile money account.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Evaluate: 18 + 24 ÷ 3 - 5 × 2\r\n   \r\n   Step 1: Multiplication and Division (left to right): 18 + 8 - 5 × 2\r\n   Step 2: Multiplication: 18 + 8 - 10\r\n   Step 3: Addition and Subtraction (left to right): 26 - 10 = 16\r\n\r\n   Answer: 16\r\n\r\n2. Ama bought 3 packs of pencils. Each pack contains 12 pencils and costs GH₵4. How much did Ama spend on the pencils?\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: Picture of pencil packs with a price tag]\r\n\r\n   Step 1: Given information:\r\n   - Number of packs: 3\r\n   - Number of pencils per pack: 12\r\n   - Cost per pack: GH₵4\r\n\r\n   Step 2: Operation needed: Multiplication\r\n\r\n   Step 3: Equation: Total cost = Number of packs × Cost per pack\r\n\r\n   Step 4: Solve: Total cost = 3 × 4 = GH₵12\r\n\r\n   Answer: Ama spent GH₵12 on the pencils.\r\n\r\n3.

Translate word problems into algebraic expressions\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nAlgebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It plays a crucial role in solving real-world problems and is essential for higher-level mathematics. In Ghana, algebra is used in various aspects of daily life, such as calculating profits at the market, managing personal finances through mobile money, and even in farming when determining the amount of fertilizer needed for a specific land area.\r\n\r\nFor Ghanaian JHS 1 students, understanding algebraic expressions is a key component of the BECE mathematics curriculum. By mastering the concepts and skills taught in this section, you will be better prepared to tackle the challenges presented in the BECE exam and build a strong foundation for future mathematical learning.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Variables and Algebraic Expressions\r\nIn algebra, we use **variables** to represent unknown quantities. A variable is typically a letter, such as x, y, or z, that stands in place of a number. An **algebraic expression** is a combination of variables, numbers, and operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).\r\n\r\nFor example, if we let x represent the number of mangoes sold at a market, then the expression 2x + 5 could represent the total cost of the mangoes, where each mango costs GH₵2, and there is an additional fixed cost of GH₵5.\r\n\r\n### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions\r\nTo simplify an algebraic expression, we perform the given operations and combine like terms. **Like terms** are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the expression 3x + 2y - x + 4y. To simplify this, we combine like terms:\r\n- 3x - x = 2x\r\n- 2y + 4y = 6y\r\n\r\nSo, the simplified expression is 2x + 6y.\r\n\r\n### Evaluating Algebraic Expressions\r\nTo evaluate an algebraic expression, we substitute a specific value for each variable and then compute the result.\r\n\r\nFor instance, let's evaluate the expression 2x + 3 when x = 5:\r\n- 2x + 3 = 2(5) + 3\r\n- 2x + 3 = 10 + 3\r\n- 2x + 3 = 13\r\n\r\n### Translating Word Problems into Algebraic Expressions\r\nMany real-world problems can be solved using algebra. To do this, we need to translate the word problem into an algebraic expression.\r\n\r\nLet's consider an example:\r\n> Kofi is 3 years older than Ama. If Ama's age is represented by a, write an expression for Kofi's age.\r\n\r\nIn this case, we can express Kofi's age as a + 3.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Simplify the expression 4x - 2y + 3x + 5y - 7.\r\n   - 4x + 3x - 2y + 5y - 7\r\n   - 7x + 3y - 7\r\n   \r\n2. Evaluate the expression 3x^2 - 2x + 1 when x = 4.\r\n   - 3(4)^2 - 2(4) + 1\r\n   - 3(16) - 8 + 1\r\n   - 48 - 8 + 1\r\n   - 41\r\n   \r\n3. Adwoa bought 3 pens and 2 notebooks. Each pen costs GH₵1.50, and each notebook costs GH₵4. Write an algebraic expression for the total cost of Adwoa's purchase.\r\n\r\nLet p represent the number of pens and n represent the number of notebooks.\r\nTotal cost = (cost per pen × number of pens) + (cost per notebook × number of notebooks)\r\nTotal cost = 1.50p + 4n\r\n\r\nFor Adwoa's purchase:\r\nTotal cost = 1.50(3) + 4(2) = 4.50 + 8 = GH₵12.50\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. Simplify the expression 5m - 3n + 2m - 6n + 1.\r\n2. Evaluate the expression 2x^2 + 3x - 1 when x = -2.\r\n3. Kwame is 5 years younger than twice Abena's age.

Write algebraic expressions using variables and constants\r\n3. Evaluate algebraic expressions by substituting values for variables\r\n4. Simplify algebraic expressions by combining like terms\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nAlgebra is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It has many applications in our daily lives, from calculating prices at the market to managing mobile money transactions. For example, if you buy 3 bags of rice at GH₵50 each and 2 bottles of oil at GH₵20 each, you can represent the total cost as an algebraic expression: 3x + 2y, where x is the price of a bag of rice and y is the price of a bottle of oil. By learning algebraic expressions, you'll develop problem-solving skills that will help you in your future studies and careers, especially as you prepare for the BECE and WAEC exams.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n\r\n### Variables and Constants\r\nIn algebraic expressions, we use symbols called **variables** to represent unknown or changing values. Variables are usually represented by letters, such as x, y, or z. For example, in the expression 3x + 5, x is a variable because its value can change.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, **constants** are values that remain fixed. In the expression 3x + 5, the numbers 3 and 5 are constants.\r\n\r\n### Writing Algebraic Expressions\r\nTo write an algebraic expression, we combine variables, constants, and operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n| Expression | Meaning |\r\n|------------|---------|\r\n| 2x + 3 | Two times a number, plus three |\r\n| 5y - 7 | Five times a number, minus seven |\r\n| 4ab | Four times the product of two numbers |\r\n\r\n### Evaluating Algebraic Expressions\r\nTo evaluate an algebraic expression, we substitute values for the variables and then simplify the result. For example, let's evaluate the expression 3x + 5 when x = 2.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Substitute x with 2\r\n3(2) + 5\r\n\r\nStep 2: Simplify\r\n6 + 5 = 11\r\n\r\nSo, when x = 2, the expression 3x + 5 evaluates to 11.\r\n\r\n### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions\r\nTo simplify an algebraic expression, we combine like terms. **Like terms** are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers. For example, 3x and 5x are like terms, but 3x and 5y are not.\r\n\r\nTo simplify an expression, follow these steps:\r\n1. Identify like terms\r\n2. Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms\r\n3. Write the result with the common variable\r\n\r\nExample: Simplify 4x + 3y - 2x + 7y\r\n\r\nStep 1: Identify like terms\r\n- 4x and -2x are like terms\r\n- 3y and 7y are like terms\r\n\r\nStep 2: Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms\r\n- 4x - 2x = 2x\r\n- 3y + 7y = 10y\r\n\r\nStep 3: Write the result with the common variable\r\n2x + 10y\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n\r\n1. A farmer has a rectangular field with length 'l' meters and width 3 meters less than the length. Write an expression for the field's perimeter.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Rectangle with length 'l' and width 'l-3']\r\n\r\nThe perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2(l + w)\r\n- Length = l\r\n- Width = l - 3\r\n\r\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\r\nP = 2(l + (l - 3))\r\nP = 2(2l - 3)\r\n\r\nTherefore, the expression for the perimeter is 2(2l - 3) or 4l - 6.\r\n\r\n2. Kofi has 5 more pens than Ama. If Ama has 'p' pens, write an expression for the total number of pens they have together.\r\n\r\nLet's define the variables:\r\n- Ama's pens = p\r\n- Kofi's pens = p + 5\r\n\r\nTo find the total number of pens, add Ama's and Kofi's pens:\r\nTotal pens = Ama's pens + Kofi's pens\r\nTotal pens = p + (p + 5)\r\nTotal pens = 2p + 5\r\n\r\n3. Evaluate the expression 4x - 3 when x = 6.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Substitute x with 6\r\n4(6) - 3\r\n\r\nStep 2: Simplify\r\n24 - 3 = 21\r\n\r\nSo, when x = 6, the expression 4x - 3 evaluates to 21.\r\n\r\n4. Simplify the expression 5m - 2n + 3m + 4n.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Identify like terms\r\n- 5m and 3m are like terms\r\n- -2n and 4n are like terms\r\n\r\nStep 2: Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms\r\n- 5m + 3m = 8m\r\n- -2n + 4n = 2n\r\n\r\nStep 3: Write the result with the common variable\r\n8m + 2n\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1.

Combine like terms to simplify algebraic expressions\r\n3. Apply the distributive property to expand expressions\r\n4. Simplify expressions involving multiple operations and brackets\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nAlgebraic expressions are an essential part of mathematics that help us represent real-life situations using symbols and numbers. In Ghana, we encounter algebraic expressions in various aspects of our daily lives. For example, when you go to the market to buy groceries, you might need to calculate the total cost of your purchases. If you buy 2 kilograms of rice at GH₵5 per kilogram and 3 kilograms of beans at GH₵8 per kilogram, you can express the total cost as 2(5) + 3(8), which is an algebraic expression.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when using mobile money services like MTN MoMo or Vodafone Cash, you might need to calculate the total amount you'll receive after sending money and deducting the transaction fee. If you send an amount 'x' and the transaction fee is 1% of the sent amount, you can express the total amount received as 0.99x, another algebraic expression.\r\n\r\nAs you prepare for your BECE exams, mastering the simplification of algebraic expressions will help you solve complex mathematical problems and apply your skills to real-life situations in Ghana.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Terms, Coefficients, and Like Terms\r\nIn an algebraic expression, a **term** is a constant, a variable, or a product of constants and variables. For example, in the expression 3x + 5y - 2, the terms are 3x, 5y, and -2.\r\n\r\nA **coefficient** is the numeric factor of a term that contains a variable. In the term 3x, the coefficient is 3.\r\n\r\n**Like terms** are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers. For example, 2x and 7x are like terms, but 2x and 7x² are not.\r\n\r\n### Combining Like Terms\r\nTo simplify an algebraic expression, we combine like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients. For example:\r\n\r\n3x + 5x = (3 + 5)x = 8x\r\n2y - 7y = (2 - 7)y = -5y\r\n\r\n### Distributive Property\r\nThe **distributive property** states that a(b + c) = ab + ac. This property allows us to expand expressions. For example:\r\n\r\n2(3x + 4) = 2(3x) + 2(4) = 6x + 8\r\n\r\n### Simplifying Expressions with Multiple Operations and Brackets\r\nWhen simplifying expressions with multiple operations and brackets, follow the order of operations: PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right). For example:\r\n\r\n2x + 3(4x - 5) - 2(x + 3)\r\n= 2x + 12x - 15 - 2x - 6\r\n= 2x + 12x - 2x - 15 - 6\r\n= 12x - 21\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Simplify: 5m - 3n + 2m + 7n\r\n   * 5m + 2m = 7m\r\n   * -3n + 7n = 4n\r\n   * Simplified expression: 7m + 4n\r\n\r\n2. Expand and simplify: 3(2x - 5) + 4(x + 3)\r\n   * Distributive property: 3(2x - 5) = 6x - 15 and 4(x + 3) = 4x + 12\r\n   * Combine like terms: 6x + 4x = 10x and -15 + 12 = -3\r\n   * Simplified expression: 10x - 3\r\n\r\n3.

Translate word problems into linear equations and solve them\r\n4. Apply linear equations to real-life situations in the Ghanaian context\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nLinear equations are a fundamental concept in algebra and have numerous applications in daily life. In Ghana, we encounter linear equations in various situations, such as calculating the cost of items in the market, determining the amount of money needed for a mobile money transaction, or estimating the yield of a farm based on the number of crops planted. Understanding linear equations is also crucial for success in the BECE mathematics exam, as it forms a significant portion of the syllabus.\r\n\r\nAs Ghanaian students, it is essential to master the skills of forming and solving linear equations to solve problems efficiently in both academic and real-life situations. By the end of this section, you will be equipped with the knowledge and techniques needed to tackle linear equations with confidence.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Components of a Linear Equation\r\nA linear equation is an equation that can be written in the form **ax + b = c**, where **a**, **b**, and **c** are real numbers and **a ≠ 0**. In this equation:\r\n- **a** is the coefficient of the variable **x**\r\n- **b** is the constant term\r\n- **c** is the value on the right-hand side of the equation\r\n\r\nFor example, in the equation **3x + 7 = 19**, we have:\r\n- a = 3\r\n- b = 7\r\n- c = 19\r\n\r\n### Solving Linear Equations using Properties of Equality\r\nTo solve a linear equation, we use the following properties of equality:\r\n1. Addition Property of Equality: If **a = b**, then **a + c = b + c** for any real number **c**.\r\n2. Multiplication Property of Equality: If **a = b**, then **ac = bc** for any non-zero real number **c**.\r\n\r\nThese properties allow us to perform operations on both sides of an equation without changing the equality.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Balance scale with equal weights on both sides, representing the properties of equality]\r\n\r\n### Step-by-Step Procedure for Solving Linear Equations\r\nTo solve a linear equation:\r\n1. Simplify both sides of the equation by combining like terms.\r\n2. Use the addition property of equality to isolate the variable term on one side of the equation.\r\n3. Use the multiplication property of equality to make the coefficient of the variable term equal to 1.\r\n4. Simplify the equation to find the solution for the variable.\r\n\r\n| Property                    | Equation    | Operation                                         |\r\n|-----------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Addition Property           | a + c = b + c | Add the same value to both sides                  |\r\n| Multiplication Property     | ac = bc       | Multiply both sides by the same non-zero value    |\r\n\r\n### Translating Word Problems into Linear Equations\r\nMany real-life problems can be solved using linear equations. To translate a word problem into a linear equation:\r\n1. Identify the unknown quantity and represent it with a variable (e.g., x).\r\n2. Write an equation that represents the relationship between the known and unknown quantities.\r\n3. Solve the equation to find the value of the unknown quantity.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram showing the process of translating a word problem into a linear equation]\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Solve for x: 4x - 7 = 9\r\n   Step 1: Add 7 to both sides of the equation\r\n   4x - 7 + 7 = 9 + 7\r\n   4x = 16\r\n\r\n   Step 2: Divide both sides by 4\r\n   4x ÷ 4 = 16 ÷ 4\r\n   x = 4\r\n\r\n   Therefore, the solution is x = 4.\r\n\r\n2. Kofi has GH₵150 in his mobile money account. He sends GH₵50 to his brother and receives GH₵30 from his sister. If he spends GH₵20 on airtime, how much money does Kofi have left in his account?\r\n   Let x be the amount of money Kofi has left in his account.\r\n   Initial amount: GH₵150\r\n   Amount sent: GH₵50\r\n   Amount received: GH₵30\r\n   Amount spent on airtime: GH₵20\r\n\r\n   Equation: 150 - 50 + 30 - 20 = x\r\n   Simplify: 110 = x\r\n\r\n   Therefore, Kofi has GH₵110 left in his mobile money account.\r\n\r\n3. A farmer planted 120 cassava plants and 90 yam plants. Each cassava plant yields 5 tubers, and each yam plant yields 3 tubers. How many tubers will the farmer harvest in total?\r\n   Let x be the total number of tubers harvested.\r\n   Number of cassava plants: 120\r\n   Yield per cassava plant: 5 tubers\r\n   Number of yam plants: 90\r\n   Yield per yam plant: 3 tubers\r\n\r\n   Equation: 120 × 5 + 90 × 3 = x\r\n   Simplify: 600 + 270 = x\r\n             870 = x\r\n\r\n   Therefore, the farmer will harvest a total of 870 tubers.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1.

For example, when we go to the market to buy ingredients for our favorite dishes, we might need to calculate the total cost based on the price per unit and the number of units we buy. Similarly, when using mobile money services, we need to understand how the fees are calculated based on the amount we send or receive. \r\n\r\nIn this chapter, we will learn about substitution in algebraic expressions, which is a crucial skill for solving real-world problems and preparing for the BECE exams. By mastering this concept, you will be able to tackle a wide range of mathematical challenges and apply your knowledge to everyday situations.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### What is Substitution?\r\n**Substitution** is the process of replacing a variable in an algebraic expression with a specific value. When we substitute a value for a variable, we can evaluate the expression and find its numerical value.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the expression $2x + 3$. If we substitute $x = 5$, the expression becomes:\r\n\r\n$2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13$\r\n\r\n### Simplifying Expressions after Substitution\r\nAfter substituting values into an algebraic expression, we often need to simplify the resulting expression. To do this, we follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):\r\n\r\n1. Parentheses\r\n2. Exponents\r\n3. Multiplication and Division (left to right)\r\n4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)\r\n\r\nFor example, let's simplify the expression $3x^2 - 2(x + 1)$ when $x = 4$.\r\n\r\n$3(4)^2 - 2(4 + 1)$\r\n$= 3(16) - 2(5)$\r\n$= 48 - 10$\r\n$= 38$\r\n\r\n### Substitution in Formulas\r\nSubstitution is often used when working with formulas. A **formula** is an equation that shows the relationship between different variables. Here are some common formulas:\r\n\r\n| Formula | Meaning |\r\n|---------|---------|\r\n| $A = L \\times W$ | Area of a rectangle |\r\n| $P = 2L + 2W$ | Perimeter of a rectangle |\r\n| $d = rt$ | Distance traveled at a constant speed |\r\n\r\nTo use a formula, we substitute the given values for the variables and then evaluate the expression.\r\n\r\n### Real-World Applications\r\nSubstitution is essential for solving real-world problems involving algebraic expressions. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\n1. A taxi charges a flat rate of GH₵5 plus GH₵2 per kilometer traveled. If the taxi travels $x$ kilometers, the total fare can be expressed as $2x + 5$. \r\n\r\n2.

Use angle properties to solve real-life problems\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nGeometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, and positions of objects. It has numerous applications in our daily lives, from the design of buildings to the calculation of distances. In Ghana, geometry plays a crucial role in various aspects of life. For example, market traders use geometric concepts to arrange their goods and calculate prices, while farmers use geometry to measure land and plan crop layouts. Understanding lines and angles, which are fundamental concepts in geometry, will not only help you excel in your BECE exams but also enable you to solve real-life problems efficiently.\r\n\r\nImagine you are helping your uncle to design a new roofing system for his house. To ensure that the roof is stable and properly aligned, you will need to apply your knowledge of angles and lines. By understanding the properties of parallel lines and the angles formed by the roof's support beams, you can create a strong and durable structure. Geometry is also essential when it comes to managing finances, such as calculating interest rates on mobile money transactions or determining the best value for money when comparing prices of goods in the market.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Types of Lines and Angles\r\nIn geometry, there are different types of lines and angles:\r\n- **Parallel lines**: Two lines that never intersect and maintain a constant distance apart\r\n- **Perpendicular lines**: Two lines that intersect at a 90° angle\r\n- **Acute angle**: An angle measuring less than 90°\r\n- **Right angle**: An angle measuring exactly 90°\r\n- **Obtuse angle**: An angle measuring greater than 90° but less than 180°\r\n- **Straight angle**: An angle measuring exactly 180°\r\n\r\n### Measuring and Constructing Angles\r\nTo measure angles, we use a protractor. A protractor is a semicircular tool with angle measurements marked on it. To measure an angle:\r\n1. Place the center of the protractor on the vertex of the angle\r\n2. Align one side of the angle with the 0° mark on the protractor\r\n3. Read the measurement where the other side of the angle intersects the protractor scale\r\n\r\nTo construct an angle of a given size:\r\n1. Draw a line and mark a point on it (the vertex)\r\n2. Place the center of the protractor on the vertex and align the 0° mark with the line\r\n3. Make a mark on the paper at the desired angle measurement\r\n4. Remove the protractor and connect the vertex to the mark with a straight line\r\n\r\n### Properties of Angles\r\nAngles have several important properties:\r\n- Angles on a straight line add up to 180°\r\n- Angles at a point add up to 360°\r\n- When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal, alternate angles are equal, and co-interior angles are supplementary (add up to 180°)\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram showing angles on a straight line, at a point, and in parallel lines with a transversal]\r\n\r\n### Angles in Triangles and Quadrilaterals\r\nIn triangles:\r\n- The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°\r\n- In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal\r\n- In an equilateral triangle, all angles measure 60°\r\n\r\nIn quadrilaterals:\r\n- The sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is always 360°\r\n- In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary\r\n- In a rectangle, all angles are 90°\r\n- In a square, all angles are 90°, and all sides are equal\r\n\r\n| Shape         | Angle Sum | Properties                                 |\r\n|---------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|\r\n| Triangle      | 180°      | Isosceles: base angles equal                |\r\n|               |           | Equilateral: all angles 60°                 |\r\n| Quadrilateral | 360°      | Parallelogram: opposite angles equal        |\r\n|               |           | Rectangle: all angles 90°                   |\r\n|               |           | Square: all angles 90°, all sides equal     |\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. In a triangle ABC, angle A measures 50°, and angle B measures 70°. Calculate the size of angle C.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Recall that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°.\r\nStep 2: Let the size of angle C be x°.

Then, 120° + x° = 180°.\r\nStep 3: Subtract 120° from both sides: x° = 180° - 120° = 60°.\r\nTherefore, angle EFD measures 60°.\r\n\r\n3.

In Ghana, we use geometry every day, often without realizing it. Market traders calculate areas to determine how much produce they can display on their stalls. Farmers measure the perimeters of their fields to know how much fencing they need. Carpenters use the Pythagorean theorem to ensure their furniture has square corners. As you prepare for the BECE exam, mastering the properties of triangles and quadrilaterals will help you solve practical problems and excel in your future studies.\r\n\r\nImagine you are helping your uncle set up his mobile money kiosk in Kumasi. He wants to make sure the kiosk is large enough to serve customers comfortably, but not so large that it takes up too much space on the busy street. By calculating the area of the kiosk floor, you can help him find the perfect size. Or perhaps you are planning to tile the floor of your family's bathroom. By understanding the properties of rectangles and squares, you can determine how many tiles you need and create a beautiful, symmetrical pattern. Geometry is not just about abstract shapes; it is a powerful tool for solving real-world problems in Ghana and beyond.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Classification of Triangles\r\nTriangles can be classified based on the lengths of their sides or the measures of their angles:\r\n- **Equilateral triangle**: All three sides have equal length, and all three angles measure 60°.\r\n- **Isosceles triangle**: Two sides have equal length, and two angles have equal measure.\r\n- **Scalene triangle**: All three sides have different lengths, and all three angles have different measures.\r\n- **Right-angled triangle**: One angle measures 90° (a right angle).\r\n\r\n### Classification of Quadrilaterals\r\nQuadrilaterals can be classified based on their properties:\r\n- **Square**: All four sides have equal length, and all four angles measure 90°.\r\n- **Rectangle**: Opposite sides have equal length, and all four angles measure 90°.\r\n- **Parallelogram**: Opposite sides have equal length and are parallel.\r\n- **Rhombus**: All four sides have equal length, and opposite angles have equal measure.\r\n- **Trapezoid**: One pair of opposite sides is parallel.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagrams of different types of triangles and quadrilaterals, labeled with their properties]\r\n\r\n### Perimeter and Area Formulas\r\nTo calculate the perimeter and area of triangles and quadrilaterals, use the following formulas:\r\n\r\n| Shape | Perimeter Formula | Area Formula |\r\n|-------|------------------|--------------|\r\n| Triangle | $P = a + b + c$ | $A = \\frac{1}{2}bh$ |\r\n| Square | $P = 4s$ | $A = s^2$ |\r\n| Rectangle | $P = 2(l + w)$ | $A = lw$ |\r\n| Parallelogram | $P = 2(a + b)$ | $A = bh$ |\r\n| Rhombus | $P = 4s$ | $A = \\frac{1}{2}d_1d_2$ |\r\n| Trapezoid | $P = a + b + c + d$ | $A = \\frac{1}{2}(a + b)h$ |\r\n\r\nwhere $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are the side lengths, $s$ is the length of a square's side, $l$ and $w$ are the length and width of a rectangle, $h$ is the height of a triangle or parallelogram, and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the diagonals of a rhombus.\r\n\r\n### The Pythagorean Theorem\r\nThe Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

Identify and classify different types of symmetry (line, rotational, point) in 2D shapes.\r\n2. Determine the order of rotational symmetry for regular polygons.\r\n3. Draw lines of symmetry and rotational symmetry for various 2D shapes.\r\n4. Apply the properties of symmetry to solve geometric problems.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nSymmetry is a fundamental concept in mathematics and is widely observed in our daily lives. In Ghana, we can find numerous examples of symmetry, from the intricate patterns in Kente cloth to the symmetrical structures of buildings like the Independence Arch in Accra. Understanding symmetry is essential for Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE examination, as it forms a significant portion of the geometry questions.\r\n\r\nIn this section, we will explore the different types of symmetry and learn how to identify and apply them to various shapes. By mastering the concepts of symmetry, students will develop a deeper understanding of geometry and enhance their problem-solving skills, which will be invaluable in their future studies and careers, whether they aspire to become architects, engineers, or designers.\r\n\r\n### Main Content\r\n#### Types of Symmetry\r\nThere are three main types of symmetry in 2D shapes:\r\n1. **Line symmetry**: A shape has line symmetry if it can be divided into two identical halves by a straight line, called the **line of symmetry**. The two halves are mirror images of each other.\r\n2. **Rotational symmetry**: A shape has rotational symmetry if it can be rotated less than 360° about a fixed point (the **center of rotation**) and still look the same.\r\n3. **Point symmetry**: A shape has point symmetry if, for every point on the shape, there is a corresponding point on the opposite side of the central point (the **point of symmetry**) at an equal distance.\r\n\r\n#### Line Symmetry\r\nTo determine if a shape has line symmetry, follow these steps:\r\n1. Imagine folding the shape along a straight line.\r\n2. If the two halves of the shape perfectly overlap, the shape has line symmetry, and the fold line is the line of symmetry.\r\n3. A shape can have multiple lines of symmetry.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Examples of shapes with different numbers of lines of symmetry (e.g., square, rectangle, equilateral triangle, circle)]\r\n\r\n| Shape                 | Number of Lines of Symmetry |\r\n|-----------------------|----------------------------|\r\n| Square                | 4                          |\r\n| Rectangle             | 2                          |\r\n| Equilateral Triangle  | 3                          |\r\n| Circle                | Infinite                   |\r\n\r\n#### Rotational Symmetry\r\nTo determine the order of rotational symmetry for a shape, follow these steps:\r\n1. Rotate the shape about its center point.\r\n2. Count the number of times the shape looks the same during one complete rotation (360°).\r\n3. The **order of rotational symmetry** is the number of times the shape looks the same during one complete rotation.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Examples of shapes with different orders of rotational symmetry (e.g., square, equilateral triangle, pentagon, hexagon)]\r\n\r\n| Shape                 | Order of Rotational Symmetry |\r\n|-----------------------|------------------------------|\r\n| Square                | 4                            |\r\n| Equilateral Triangle  | 3                            |\r\n| Pentagon              | 5                            |\r\n| Hexagon               | 6                            |\r\n\r\n#### Point Symmetry\r\nTo determine if a shape has point symmetry, follow these steps:\r\n1. Choose a point inside the shape (usually the center).\r\n2. For each point on the shape, find the corresponding point on the opposite side of the central point at an equal distance.\r\n3. If every point has a corresponding point, the shape has point symmetry.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Examples of shapes with and without point symmetry (e.g., circle, parallelogram, kite)]\r\n\r\n### Worked Examples\r\n1.

Yes, the flag has point symmetry because for every point on the flag, there is a corresponding point on the opposite side of the black star at an equal distance.\r\n3. 6\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n- The three main types of symmetry in 2D shapes are line symmetry, rotational symmetry, and point symmetry.\r\n- A shape has line symmetry if it can be divided into two identical halves by a straight line called the line of symmetry.\r\n- A shape has rotational symmetry if it can be rotated less than 360° about its center and still look the same. The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times the shape looks the same during one complete rotation.\r\n- A shape has point symmetry if, for every point on the shape, there is a corresponding point on the opposite side of the central point at an equal distance.\r\n- Regular polygons have both line symmetry and rotational symmetry.\r\n\r\n### Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n| Term/Formula            | Meaning/Use                                                                            |\r\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Line of symmetry        | A straight line that divides a shape into two identical halves                         |\r\n| Rotational symmetry     | A shape can be rotated less than 360° about its center and still look the same         |\r\n| Order of rotational symmetry | The number of times a shape looks the same during one complete rotation (360°) |\r\n| Point symmetry          | For every point on the shape, there is a corresponding point on the opposite side of the central point at an equal distance |\r\n| Center of rotation      | The fixed point about which a shape is rotated                                         |\r\n| Point of symmetry       | The central point in a shape with point symmetry                                       |",

Construct triangles (equilateral, isosceles, and right-angled) using a pair of compasses and a ruler.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nGeometric constructions are an essential part of mathematics that have many real-life applications. In Ghana, these skills can be used in various situations, such as designing layouts for farms, creating patterns for clothing, or planning the construction of buildings. For example, a farmer in the Volta Region may need to divide their land into equal parts for different crops, which can be done using angle bisection. A seamstress in Kumasi might use parallel lines to create a consistent pattern on a piece of fabric for a new dress. Preparing for the BECE exams also requires a strong understanding of geometric constructions, as these topics are frequently tested. By mastering the skills in this section, students will be well-equipped to tackle problems both in their daily lives and in their academic pursuits.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Constructing Angles (90°, 60°, 45°, and 30°)\r\nTo construct specific angles using a pair of compasses and a ruler, follow these steps:\r\n1. Draw a straight line and mark a point on it. This will be the vertex of the angle.\r\n2. Place the compass point on the vertex and draw an arc that intersects the line at two points.\r\n3. Place the compass point on one of the intersections and draw an arc above or below the line.\r\n4. Without changing the compass width, place the point on the other intersection and draw another arc that crosses the first arc.\r\n5. Draw a line from the vertex through the point where the two arcs cross. This line forms the desired angle with the original line.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram showing the steps to construct a 60° angle]\r\n\r\nTo construct a 90° angle, follow the same steps but ensure that the two arcs drawn in step 3 and 4 are of equal radius and that they intersect at a point equidistant from the vertex.\r\n\r\nFor a 45° angle, first construct a 90° angle and then bisect it using the angle bisection method described below.\r\n\r\nTo construct a 30° angle, first construct a 60° angle and then bisect it.\r\n\r\n### Bisecting an Angle\r\nTo bisect an angle using a pair of compasses and a ruler:\r\n1. Place the compass point on the vertex of the angle and draw an arc that intersects both sides of the angle.\r\n2. Without changing the compass width, place the point on one of the intersections and draw an arc inside the angle.\r\n3. Repeat step 2 with the other intersection.\r\n4. Draw a line from the vertex through the point where the two arcs cross. This line bisects the angle.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram showing the steps to bisect an angle]\r\n\r\n### Constructing Parallel Lines\r\nTo construct a line parallel to a given line through a point:\r\n1. Draw a line and mark a point above or below the line.\r\n2. Place the compass point on the given point and draw an arc that intersects the line at two points.\r\n3.

Place the compass point on the other intersection and draw another arc that crosses the first arc.\r\n5. Draw a line through the given point and the point where the two arcs cross. This line is parallel to the original line.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram showing the steps to construct a line parallel to a given line through a point]\r\n\r\n### Constructing Triangles\r\nTo construct an equilateral triangle:\r\n1. Draw a line segment of the desired length.\r\n2. Place the compass point on one end of the segment and draw an arc with radius equal to the segment length.\r\n3. Repeat step 2 with the other end of the segment.\r\n4. Draw lines connecting the ends of the original segment to the point where the two arcs cross. This forms an equilateral triangle.\r\n\r\nTo construct an isosceles triangle:\r\n1. Draw a line segment of the desired length for the base.\r\n2. Place the compass point on one end of the segment and draw an arc with the desired radius for the equal sides.\r\n3. Repeat step 2 with the other end of the segment.\r\n4. Draw lines connecting the ends of the base to the point where the two arcs cross. This forms an isosceles triangle.\r\n\r\nTo construct a right-angled triangle:\r\n1. Draw a line segment for the base of the triangle.\r\n2. Construct a 90° angle at one end of the segment using the method described earlier.\r\n3. Mark the desired length for the height of the triangle on the line forming the 90° angle.\r\n4. Draw a line connecting the mark on the height to the other end of the base. This forms a right-angled triangle.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Kofi wants to divide his rectangular farm into four equal parts so that he can grow different crops. If the farm measures 120 meters by 90 meters, how can he use geometric constructions to divide the land?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- First, construct a perpendicular bisector of the 120-meter side:\r\n  a. Place the compass point on one end of the 120-meter side and draw an arc above and below the side.\r\n  b. Repeat step a with the other end of the side.\r\n  c. Draw a line connecting the points where the arcs intersect. This line bisects the 120-meter side and is perpendicular to it.\r\n- Repeat the process to construct a perpendicular bisector of the 90-meter side.\r\n- The two perpendicular bisectors divide the farm into four equal parts, each measuring 60 meters by 45 meters.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram showing the rectangular farm divided into four equal parts]\r\n\r\n2. Adwoa is designing a new dress pattern and wants to create a series of parallel lines 5 cm apart. If she starts with a line segment measuring 30 cm, how can she construct the parallel lines using a pair of compasses and a ruler?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Draw a line segment measuring 30 cm.\r\n- Mark points at 5 cm intervals along the line segment.\r\n- Use the method for constructing parallel lines through a point:\r\n  a.

Convert between different units of length, mass, and time\r\n2. Solve problems involving length, mass, and time using the four basic operations\r\n3. Calculate the perimeter and area of simple shapes\r\n4. Interpret and create tables and graphs related to length, mass, and time measurements\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nMeasurement is a fundamental aspect of mathematics that has countless applications in our daily lives. In Ghana, we encounter measurements every day, whether we are buying goods at the market, managing our mobile money accounts, or helping our families with farming tasks. By mastering the concepts of length, mass, and time, we can develop essential skills that will serve us well in both practical situations and academic pursuits, such as preparing for the BECE exams.\r\n\r\nAs we explore this topic, we will learn how to convert between different units of measurement, perform calculations involving length, mass, and time, and even determine the perimeter and area of simple shapes. These skills will not only help us excel in mathematics but also enable us to make informed decisions in our daily lives and future careers.\r\n\r\n### Main Content\r\n#### Units of Measurement\r\nIn Ghana, we use the **metric system** for measuring length, mass, and time. The basic units of measurement are:\r\n- Length: **meter (m)**\r\n- Mass: **gram (g)**\r\n- Time: **second (s)**\r\n\r\nTo express larger or smaller quantities, we use prefixes such as kilo- (k), centi- (c), and milli- (m). For example:\r\n- 1 kilometer (km) = 1,000 meters (m)\r\n- 1 centimeter (cm) = 0.01 meter (m)\r\n- 1 kilogram (kg) = 1,000 grams (g)\r\n- 1 milligram (mg) = 0.001 gram (g)\r\n\r\n| Prefix | Abbreviation | Meaning      |\r\n|--------|--------------|--------------|\r\n| kilo-  | k            | 1,000 times  |\r\n| centi- | c            | 1/100 times  |\r\n| milli- | m            | 1/1,000 times|\r\n\r\n#### Converting Units\r\nTo convert between different units of measurement, we can use multiplication or division. For example:\r\n- To convert 5 km to meters: 5 km × 1,000 = 5,000 m\r\n- To convert 3,500 g to kilograms: 3,500 g ÷ 1,000 = 3.5 kg\r\n\r\nWhen converting time, it's essential to remember the relationships between seconds, minutes, and hours:\r\n- 1 minute = 60 seconds\r\n- 1 hour = 60 minutes = 3,600 seconds\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A table showing the relationships between different units of time, including seconds, minutes, and hours]\r\n\r\n#### Perimeter and Area\r\nPerimeter is the distance around a shape, while area is the amount of space inside a shape. To calculate the perimeter of a rectangle, we use the formula:\r\n\r\n$P = 2(l + w)$\r\n\r\nwhere $P$ is the perimeter, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.\r\n\r\nTo find the area of a rectangle, we use the formula:\r\n\r\n$A = l × w$\r\n\r\nwhere $A$ is the area, $l$ is the length, and $w$ is the width.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram of a rectangle with its length and width labeled, along with the formulas for perimeter and area]\r\n\r\n#### Data Interpretation\r\nMeasurements of length, mass, and time can be represented using tables and graphs. By learning to interpret and create these visual representations, we can better understand and communicate information related to measurements.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: An example of a graph showing the growth of a plant over time, with the x-axis representing days and the y-axis representing the plant's height in centimeters]\r\n\r\n### Worked Examples\r\n1. Kofi wants to buy a 3.5 m rope for his farm. If the rope costs GH₵1.20 per meter, how much will Kofi pay for the rope?\r\n\r\n   Given:\r\n   - Length of the rope = 3.5 m\r\n   - Cost per meter = GH₵1.20\r\n\r\n   Step 1: Calculate the total cost by multiplying the length of the rope by the cost per meter.\r\n   Total cost = 3.5 m × GH₵1.20/m = GH₵4.20\r\n\r\n   Therefore, Kofi will pay GH₵4.20 for the rope.\r\n\r\n2. Ama runs a small business selling rice. She has a bag containing 50 kg of rice. If she sells the rice in 500 g packets, how many packets can she make from the bag?\r\n\r\n   Given:\r\n   - Total mass of rice = 50 kg\r\n   - Mass of each packet = 500 g\r\n\r\n   Step 1: Convert 50 kg to grams.\r\n   50 kg = 50 × 1,000 g = 50,000 g\r\n\r\n   Step 2: Divide the total mass of rice by the mass of each packet to find the number of packets.\r\n   Number of packets = 50,000 g ÷ 500 g = 100\r\n\r\n   Therefore, Ama can make 100 packets of rice from the 50 kg bag.\r\n\r\n3. Kwame takes 45 minutes to walk to school. If he leaves home at 7:15 am, at what time will he arrive at school?\r\n\r\n   Given:\r\n   - Time taken to walk to school = 45 minutes\r\n   - Departure time from home = 7:15 am\r\n\r\n   Step 1: Add 45 minutes to the departure time.\r\n   7:15 am + 45 minutes = 8:00 am\r\n\r\n   Therefore, Kwame will arrive at school at 8:00 am.\r\n\r\n### Practice Problems\r\n1. A rectangular garden has a length of 6 m and a width of 4 m. Calculate the perimeter and area of the garden.\r\n\r\n2. Abena bought 2.5 kg of oranges and 1.75 kg of apples. What is the total mass of the fruits she bought?\r\n\r\n3. John spent 2 hours and 30 minutes studying mathematics. If he started studying at 4:45 pm, at what time did he finish?\r\n\r\nAnswers:\r\n1. Perimeter = 20 m, Area = 24 m²\r\n2. 4.25 kg\r\n3. 7:15 pm\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n- Length, mass, and time are fundamental measurements in the metric system, with basic units of meter (m), gram (g), and second (s), respectively.\r\n- To convert between units, use multiplication or division based on the relationships between the units.\r\n- Perimeter is the distance around a shape, while area is the space inside a shape. For rectangles, use the formulas $P = 2(l + w)$ and $A = l × w$.\r\n- Measurements can be represented using tables and graphs, which help in understanding and communicating information.\r\n\r\n### Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n| Term/Formula   | Meaning/Use                                 |\r\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------|\r\n| Metric system  | A system of measurement based on powers of 10|\r\n| Length         | The distance between two points              |\r\n| Mass           | The amount of matter in an object            |\r\n| Time           | The duration of an event or process          |\r\n| Perimeter      | The distance around a shape                  |\r\n| Area           | The space inside a shape                     |\r\n| $P = 2(l + w)$ | Formula for the perimeter of a rectangle     |\r\n| $A = l × w$    | Formula for the area of a rectangle          |",

Calculate the perimeter and area of rectangles, squares, and triangles using appropriate formulas.\r\n3. Solve problems involving perimeter and area in various contexts.\r\n4. Apply the concepts of perimeter and area to solve BECE-style questions.\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we often encounter situations that involve measurements, such as calculating the amount of fencing needed to enclose a garden or determining the size of a room to buy the right amount of floor tiles. These situations require an understanding of perimeter and area. As Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE, it is essential to master these concepts to solve real-life problems and excel in your exams.\r\n\r\nImagine you are helping your parents at the market stall. A customer wants to know the area of a rectangular piece of cloth to determine if it's enough for their project. By learning about perimeter and area, you can quickly calculate the dimensions and provide the customer with the information they need. Similarly, when you start your own business or manage your finances using mobile money, understanding measurements will be crucial for making informed decisions.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Understanding Perimeter\r\n**Perimeter** is the distance around the outside of a shape. It is the sum of the lengths of all sides of a closed figure. To find the perimeter, we add the lengths of all the sides.\r\n\r\nFor a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$, the perimeter is given by:\r\n$$ \\text{Perimeter of Rectangle} = 2(l + w) $$\r\n\r\nFor a square with side length $s$, the perimeter is given by:\r\n$$ \\text{Perimeter of Square} = 4s $$\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram showing a rectangle with length l and width w, and a square with side length s. Label the perimeter formulas for each shape.]\r\n\r\n### Understanding Area\r\n**Area** is the amount of space inside a closed figure. It is measured in square units, such as square centimeters (cm²), square meters (m²), or hectares (ha) for larger areas like farmland.\r\n\r\nFor a rectangle with length $l$ and width $w$, the area is given by:\r\n$$ \\text{Area of Rectangle} = l \\times w $$\r\n\r\nFor a square with side length $s$, the area is given by:\r\n$$ \\text{Area of Square} = s^2 $$\r\n\r\nFor a triangle with base $b$ and height $h$, the area is given by:\r\n$$ \\text{Area of Triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times b \\times h $$\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram showing a rectangle with length l and width w, a square with side length s, and a triangle with base b and height h.

Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the unknown value to be found.\r\n2. Determine the shape of the object (rectangle, square, triangle, or composite shape).\r\n3. Write down the appropriate formula for perimeter or area based on the shape.\r\n4. Substitute the given values into the formula.\r\n5. Perform the necessary calculations and simplify the result.\r\n6. Include the appropriate unit in your final answer (e.g., cm, m², ha).\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. A rectangular garden has a length of 12 meters and a width of 5 meters. Find the perimeter and area of the garden.\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n- Length $(l) = 12$ meters\r\n- Width $(w) = 5$ meters\r\n\r\nStep 1: Calculate the perimeter\r\n$$ \\text{Perimeter} = 2(l + w) = 2(12 + 5) = 2(17) = 34 \\text{ meters} $$\r\n\r\nStep 2: Calculate the area\r\n$$ \\text{Area} = l \\times w = 12 \\times 5 = 60 \\text{ square meters (m}^2\\text{)} $$\r\n\r\nTherefore, the perimeter of the garden is 34 meters, and the area is 60 square meters.\r\n\r\n2. Kofi wants to buy a square floor mat for his room. If the side length of the mat is 2.5 meters, calculate the perimeter and area of the mat.\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n- Side length $(s) = 2.5$ meters\r\n\r\nStep 1: Calculate the perimeter\r\n$$ \\text{Perimeter} = 4s = 4 \\times 2.5 = 10 \\text{ meters} $$\r\n\r\nStep 2: Calculate the area\r\n$$ \\text{Area} = s^2 = 2.5^2 = 6.25 \\text{ square meters (m}^2\\text{)} $$\r\n\r\nTherefore, the perimeter of the floor mat is 10 meters, and the area is 6.25 square meters.\r\n\r\n3.

Calculate the volume of cubes, cuboids, and cylinders using formulas\r\n3. Convert between different units of volume and capacity (e.g., cm³ to liters)\r\n4. Solve real-life problems involving volume and capacity in the Ghanaian context\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we often encounter situations that involve measuring the amount of space an object occupies or the quantity of a substance that a container can hold. These concepts are known as volume and capacity. Understanding volume and capacity is crucial for many real-life applications, such as calculating the amount of cement needed to build a house, determining the quantity of water a tank can store, or estimating the volume of crops harvested from a farm. In this lesson, we will explore the concepts of volume and capacity, learn how to calculate them using formulas, and apply this knowledge to solve problems in the context of Ghanaian life. Mastering these skills will not only help you in your everyday life but also prepare you for the BECE examination.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Volume\r\n**Volume** is the amount of space occupied by a three-dimensional object. It is measured in cubic units, such as cubic centimeters (cm³), cubic meters (m³), or cubic inches (in³). To calculate the volume of an object, we multiply its length, width, and height.\r\n\r\n#### Volume of a Cube\r\nA **cube** is a three-dimensional object with all its sides equal in length. The formula for the volume of a cube is:\r\n\r\n$V = s^3$\r\n\r\nwhere $V$ is the volume and $s$ is the length of one side of the cube.\r\n\r\n#### Volume of a Cuboid\r\nA **cuboid** is a three-dimensional object with rectangular faces. The formula for the volume of a cuboid is:\r\n\r\n$V = l \\times w \\times h$\r\n\r\nwhere $V$ is the volume, $l$ is the length, $w$ is the width, and $h$ is the height of the cuboid.\r\n\r\n#### Volume of a Cylinder\r\nA **cylinder** is a three-dimensional object with two identical circular bases connected by a curved surface. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:\r\n\r\n$V = \\pi r^2 h$\r\n\r\nwhere $V$ is the volume, $\\pi$ (pi) is approximately 3.14159, $r$ is the radius of the circular base, and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n| Shape   | Volume Formula    |\r\n|---------|-------------------|\r\n| Cube    | $V = s^3$         |\r\n| Cuboid  | $V = l \\times w \\times h$ |\r\n| Cylinder| $V = \\pi r^2 h$   |\r\n\r\n### Capacity\r\n**Capacity** is the maximum amount of substance that a container can hold. It is often measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). One liter is equal to 1,000 milliliters or 1,000 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\n| Unit         | Equivalent        |\r\n|--------------|-------------------|\r\n| 1 liter (L)  | 1,000 milliliters (mL) |\r\n| 1 liter (L)  | 1,000 cubic centimeters (cm³) |\r\n\r\n### Converting Units\r\nTo convert between different units of volume and capacity, we can use the following conversion factors:\r\n\r\n- 1 m³ = 1,000 L\r\n- 1 L = 1,000 mL\r\n- 1 L = 1,000 cm³\r\n\r\nTo convert from one unit to another, multiply or divide by the appropriate conversion factor.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram showing the conversion factors between cubic meters, liters, milliliters, and cubic centimeters]\r\n\r\n### Problem-Solving Steps\r\nWhen solving problems involving volume and capacity, follow these steps:\r\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the unknown quantity\r\n2. Determine the appropriate formula to use based on the shape of the object or container\r\n3. Substitute the given values into the formula and calculate the result\r\n4. If necessary, convert the result to the desired unit of measurement\r\n5. Check your answer for reasonableness and ensure that it is properly labeled with the correct unit\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. A rectangular water tank has a length of 2 meters, a width of 1.5 meters, and a height of 1 meter. Calculate the volume of the tank in liters.\r\n\r\nGiven: \r\n- Length (l) = 2 m\r\n- Width (w) = 1.5 m\r\n- Height (h) = 1 m\r\n\r\nStep 1: Determine the formula for the volume of a cuboid\r\n$V = l \\times w \\times h$\r\n\r\nStep 2: Substitute the given values into the formula\r\n$V = 2 \\text{ m} \\times 1.5 \\text{ m} \\times 1 \\text{ m} = 3 \\text{ m}^3$\r\n\r\nStep 3: Convert cubic meters to liters\r\n$3 \\text{ m}^3 = 3 \\times 1,000 \\text{ L} = 3,000 \\text{ L}$\r\n\r\nTherefore, the volume of the water tank is 3,000 liters.\r\n\r\n2. A cylindrical oil drum has a radius of 20 cm and a height of 1.2 meters. Calculate the volume of the drum in liters.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram of a cylindrical oil drum with labels for radius (r) and height (h)]\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n- Radius (r) = 20 cm = 0.2 m\r\n- Height (h) = 1.2 m\r\n\r\nStep 1: Determine the formula for the volume of a cylinder\r\n$V = \\pi r^2 h$\r\n\r\nStep 2: Substitute the given values into the formula\r\n$V = 3.14159 \\times (0.2 \\text{ m})^2 \\times 1.2 \\text{ m} \\approx 0.15 \\text{ m}^3$\r\n\r\nStep 3: Convert cubic meters to liters\r\n$0.15 \\text{ m}^3 = 0.15 \\times 1,000 \\text{ L} = 150 \\text{ L}$\r\n\r\nTherefore, the volume of the oil drum is approximately 150 liters.\r\n\r\n3. A farmer harvests cocoa beans and fills a cuboid-shaped container with a length of 1.5 meters, a width of 1 meter, and a height of 80 cm. If the farmer fills 12 such containers, what is the total volume of cocoa beans harvested in liters?\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n- Length (l) = 1.5 m\r\n- Width (w) = 1 m\r\n- Height (h) = 80 cm = 0.8 m\r\n- Number of containers = 12\r\n\r\nStep 1: Determine the formula for the volume of a cuboid\r\n$V = l \\times w \\times h$\r\n\r\nStep 2: Calculate the volume of one container\r\n$V = 1.5 \\text{ m} \\times 1 \\text{ m} \\times 0.8 \\text{ m} = 1.2 \\text{ m}^3$\r\n\r\nStep 3: Convert cubic meters to liters\r\n$1.2 \\text{ m}^3 = 1.2 \\times 1,000 \\text{ L} = 1,200 \\text{ L}$\r\n\r\nStep 4: Calculate the total volume of cocoa beans in 12 containers\r\n$\\text{Total volume} = 1,200 \\text{ L} \\times 12 = 14,400 \\text{ L}$\r\n\r\nTherefore, the total volume of cocoa beans harvested is 14,400 liters.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1.

Convert between Ghana Cedis and Pesewas\r\n2. Calculate discounts and sales prices\r\n3. Determine simple interest earned on savings\r\n4. Solve real-world problems involving money and financial calculations\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nMoney and financial calculations are an essential part of everyday life in Ghana. Whether you're buying groceries at the market, saving money in your bank account, or preparing for your future, understanding how to work with money is a crucial skill. In this section, we'll explore the mathematics behind money and financial calculations, using examples relevant to Ghanaian students like yourself. By mastering these concepts, you'll be better equipped to manage your finances and excel in your BECE exams.\r\n\r\nImagine you're at the market, and you want to buy a few items for dinner. You'll need to quickly calculate the total cost and ensure you have enough cash on hand. Or perhaps you're helping your parents with their mobile money transactions, and you need to determine the amount of interest they'll earn on their savings. These real-life scenarios demonstrate the importance of understanding money and financial calculations in your daily life as a Ghanaian student.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Converting between Ghana Cedis and Pesewas\r\nThe **Ghana Cedi (GH₵)** is the official currency of Ghana, and it is divided into 100 **Pesewas (p)**. To convert from Ghana Cedis to Pesewas, multiply the amount in Ghana Cedis by 100:\r\n\r\nPesewas = Ghana Cedis × 100\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have GH₵5.50, you can convert it to Pesewas like this:\r\n5.50 × 100 = 550p\r\n\r\nTo convert from Pesewas to Ghana Cedis, divide the amount in Pesewas by 100:\r\n\r\nGhana Cedis = Pesewas ÷ 100\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have 750p, you can convert it to Ghana Cedis like this:\r\n750 ÷ 100 = GH₵7.50\r\n\r\n### Calculating Discounts and Sales Prices\r\nWhen shops offer discounts, you can calculate the sale price using the following formula:\r\n\r\nSale Price = Original Price - Discount\r\n\r\nThe discount is usually given as a percentage of the original price. To calculate the discount amount, use this formula:\r\n\r\nDiscount = Original Price × Discount Percentage\r\n\r\nFor example, if a shirt originally costs GH₵50 and is on sale for 20% off, you can calculate the discount and sale price like this:\r\nDiscount = 50 × 0.20 = GH₵10\r\nSale Price = 50 - 10 = GH₵40\r\n\r\n### Simple Interest on Savings\r\nWhen you save money in a bank account or invest in a fixed deposit, you can earn interest on your savings. Simple interest is calculated using the following formula:\r\n\r\nInterest = Principal × Interest Rate × Time (in years)\r\n\r\n- **Principal** is the initial amount of money you save or invest.\r\n- **Interest Rate** is the percentage of the principal that you earn as interest, usually expressed as a decimal.\r\n- **Time** is the duration you save or invest the money, measured in years.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you save GH₵1000 in a bank account with a 5% annual interest rate for 3 years, you can calculate the interest you'll earn like this:\r\nInterest = 1000 × 0.05 × 3 = GH₵150\r\n\r\n| Simple Interest Formula |\r\n|--------------------------|\r\n| I = P × R × T |\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n- I = Interest\r\n- P = Principal\r\n- R = Interest Rate (as a decimal)\r\n- T = Time (in years)\r\n\r\n### Solving Real-World Problems\r\nTo solve real-world problems involving money and financial calculations, follow these steps:\r\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify the given information and the question being asked.\r\n2. Determine the appropriate formula or method to use based on the problem type (e.g., converting currency, calculating discounts, or finding simple interest).\r\n3. Substitute the given values into the formula and perform the necessary calculations.\r\n4. Double-check your work and ensure your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. Kofi wants to buy a book that costs GH₵15.75. How much will he pay in Pesewas?\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   To convert GH₵15.75 to Pesewas, multiply by 100:\r\n   15.75 × 100 = 1,575p\r\n   Therefore, Kofi will pay 1,575 Pesewas for the book.\r\n\r\n2. Adwoa sees a dress on sale for 30% off its original price of GH₵80. What is the sale price of the dress?\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   First, calculate the discount amount:\r\n   Discount = 80 × 0.30 = GH₵24\r\n   \r\n   Then, subtract the discount from the original price:\r\n   Sale Price = 80 - 24 = GH₵56\r\n   Therefore, the sale price of the dress is GH₵56.\r\n\r\n3. Kwame saves GH₵500 in a bank account that offers a 4% annual interest rate. How much interest will he earn after 5 years?\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: A timeline showing the principal amount of GH₵500 and the 5-year duration, with arrows indicating the simple interest calculation.]\r\n\r\n   Solution:\r\n   Use the simple interest formula:\r\n   Interest = Principal × Interest Rate × Time\r\n            = 500 × 0.04 × 5\r\n            = GH₵100\r\n   Therefore, Kwame will earn GH₵100 in interest after 5 years.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. Convert GH₵12.50 to Pesewas.\r\n2. A shirt originally priced at GH₵60 is on sale for 15% off. What is the sale price?\r\n3. Esi invests GH₵2,000 in a fixed deposit with a 6% annual interest rate for 2 years. How much interest will she earn?\r\n\r\n(Answers: 1. 1,250p; 2. GH₵51; 3. GH₵240)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- Convert between Ghana Cedis and Pesewas by multiplying or dividing by 100.\r\n- Calculate discounts and sales prices using the formula: Sale Price = Original Price - Discount.\r\n- Determine simple interest using the formula: Interest = Principal × Interest Rate × Time.\r\n- Solve real-world problems involving money and financial calculations by identifying the given information, using the appropriate formula, and double-checking your work.\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n\r\n| Term/Formula | Meaning/Use |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| Ghana Cedi (GH₵) | The official currency of Ghana |\r\n| Pesewa (p) | A subunit of the Ghana Cedi, equal to one-hundredth of a Cedi |\r\n| Discount | A reduction in the original price of an item, usually expressed as a percentage |\r\n| Sale Price | The price of an item after a discount has been applied |\r\n| Principal | The initial amount of money saved or invested |\r\n| Interest Rate | The percentage of the principal earned as interest, usually expressed as a decimal |\r\n| Simple Interest | The interest calculated on the principal amount only, using the formula: I = P × R × T |",

Identify and convert between different units of measurement for length, mass, and capacity\r\n2. Perform calculations involving units of measurement in real-life scenarios\r\n3. Apply the concept of scale to solve problems involving distances on maps\r\n4. Solve BECE-style problems involving units and conversions\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nMeasurement is a crucial aspect of mathematics that we encounter in our daily lives. In Ghana, we use various units of measurement for different purposes. For example, when buying groceries at the market, we often use kilograms (kg) to measure the mass of items like rice or tomatoes. When traveling between cities, we measure distances in kilometers (km). In school, we learn about measuring the capacity of liquids in liters (L). Understanding units of measurement and how to convert between them is essential for success in mathematics and everyday life.\r\n\r\nAs you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering units and conversions will help you solve problems accurately and efficiently. You will encounter questions that involve real-life scenarios, such as calculating the cost of goods at the market or determining the distance between two towns on a map. By applying your knowledge of units and conversions, you will be well-equipped to tackle these questions with confidence.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n\r\n### Units of Length\r\nIn the metric system, the basic unit of length is the **meter (m)**. Other common units of length include:\r\n- Centimeter (cm): 1 cm = 0.01 m\r\n- Millimeter (mm): 1 mm = 0.001 m\r\n- Kilometer (km): 1 km = 1000 m\r\n\r\nTo convert between units of length, we use the following formulas:\r\n| Conversion | Formula |\r\n|------------|---------|\r\n| cm to m    | divide by 100 |\r\n| mm to m    | divide by 1000 |\r\n| km to m    | multiply by 1000 |\r\n\r\nFor example, to convert 250 cm to meters:\r\n$250 \\div 100 = 2.5$ m\r\n\r\n### Units of Mass\r\nThe basic unit of mass in the metric system is the **gram (g)**. Other common units of mass include:\r\n- Kilogram (kg): 1 kg = 1000 g\r\n- Milligram (mg): 1 mg = 0.001 g\r\n\r\nTo convert between units of mass, we use the following formulas:\r\n| Conversion | Formula |\r\n|------------|---------|\r\n| kg to g    | multiply by 1000 |\r\n| mg to g    | divide by 1000 |\r\n\r\nFor example, to convert 3.5 kg to grams:\r\n$3.5 \\times 1000 = 3500$ g\r\n\r\n### Units of Capacity\r\nThe basic unit of capacity in the metric system is the **liter (L)**. Other common units of capacity include:\r\n- Milliliter (mL): 1 mL = 0.001 L\r\n- Centiliter (cL): 1 cL = 0.01 L\r\n\r\nTo convert between units of capacity, we use the following formulas:\r\n| Conversion | Formula |\r\n|------------|---------|\r\n| mL to L    | divide by 1000 |\r\n| cL to L    | divide by 100 |\r\n\r\nFor example, to convert 2500 mL to liters:\r\n$2500 \\div 1000 = 2.5$ L\r\n\r\n### Scale and Distance\r\nScale is the ratio between the distance on a map and the actual distance in real life. It is often represented as a ratio, such as 1:50,000, which means that 1 unit on the map represents 50,000 units in real life.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the actual distance using the scale, we use the following formula:\r\nActual Distance = Map Distance × Scale Factor\r\n\r\nFor example, if the distance between two towns on a map is 5 cm and the scale is 1:1,000,000, the actual distance would be:\r\n$5 \\times 1,000,000 = 5,000,000$ cm = 50 km\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n\r\n1. Adwoa bought 2.5 kg of rice and 1.75 kg of beans at the market. What is the total mass of her purchase in grams?\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nFirst, convert each mass to grams:\r\n- Rice: $2.5 \\times 1000 = 2500$ g\r\n- Beans: $1.75 \\times 1000 = 1750$ g\r\n\r\nThen, add the masses together:\r\n$2500 + 1750 = 4250$ g\r\n\r\nTherefore, the total mass of Adwoa's purchase is 4250 grams.\r\n\r\n2. Kofi needs to measure the length of his classroom for a school project. He finds that the length is 750 cm. Express this length in meters.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nTo convert centimeters to meters, divide by 100:\r\n$750 \\div 100 = 7.5$ m\r\n\r\nTherefore, the length of Kofi's classroom is 7.5 meters.\r\n\r\n3. On a map with a scale of 1:500,000, the distance between Accra and Kumasi is 12 cm. What is the actual distance between the two cities in kilometers?\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A simple map showing the locations of Accra and Kumasi, with a line connecting them. The distance on the map is labeled as 12 cm.]\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nTo find the actual distance, multiply the map distance by the scale factor:\r\nActual Distance = Map Distance × Scale Factor\r\nActual Distance = $12 \\times 500,000 = 6,000,000$ cm\r\n\r\nTo convert centimeters to kilometers, divide by 100,000:\r\n$6,000,000 \\div 100,000 = 60$ km\r\n\r\nTherefore, the actual distance between Accra and Kumasi is 60 kilometers.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n\r\n1.

Design and conduct surveys, observational studies, and experiments\r\n3. Identify the population, sample, and sampling techniques in a study\r\n4. Determine appropriate sample sizes for a given population and margin of error\r\n5. Recognize and avoid potential sources of bias in data collection\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nData collection is a crucial aspect of statistics that plays a significant role in various facets of Ghanaian life. For instance, market traders often conduct informal surveys to determine the preferences and needs of their customers, enabling them to stock the most sought-after products. In agriculture, farmers may collect data on crop yields, rainfall patterns, and soil quality to make informed decisions about planting and harvesting. Moreover, as students prepare for the BECE exams, understanding data collection methods can help them interpret and analyze statistical information presented in various subjects.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts and techniques of data collection, empowering students to gather and interpret data effectively. By mastering these skills, students will be well-equipped to tackle real-world problems and excel in their academic pursuits, particularly in preparation for the WAEC/BECE exams.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n\r\n### Types of Data Collection\r\nThere are three main types of data collection:\r\n1. **Surveys**: Collecting data by asking questions to a group of people.\r\n2. **Observational studies**: Collecting data by observing and recording information without influencing the subjects.\r\n3. **Experiments**: Collecting data by manipulating one or more variables and observing the effects on other variables.\r\n\r\n### Sampling Techniques\r\nWhen collecting data, it is often impractical to gather information from an entire population. Instead, we use sampling techniques to select a representative subset of the population. Some common sampling techniques include:\r\n1. **Simple random sampling**: Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.\r\n2. **Stratified sampling**: The population is divided into distinct subgroups (strata), and samples are taken from each stratum.\r\n3. **Cluster sampling**: The population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Diagram illustrating simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling]\r\n\r\n### Sample Size and Margin of Error\r\nThe sample size is the number of individuals or objects included in a study. A larger sample size generally leads to more accurate results but also increases the cost and time required for data collection. The margin of error is the maximum expected difference between the sample results and the true population values.\r\n\r\nTo determine the appropriate sample size, use the following formula:\r\n\r\n$n = \\frac{z^2 \\times p(1-p)}{e^2}$\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n- $n$ is the sample size\r\n- $z$ is the z-score (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% confidence level)\r\n- $p$ is the expected proportion (0.5 is often used if unknown)\r\n- $e$ is the margin of error (as a decimal)\r\n\r\n### Sources of Bias\r\nBias can occur at various stages of data collection and can lead to inaccurate or misleading results. Some common sources of bias include:\r\n1. **Sampling bias**: When the sample is not representative of the population.\r\n2. **Response bias**: When participants provide inaccurate or incomplete responses.\r\n3. **Observer bias**: When the researcher's expectations or prejudices influence the data collection process.\r\n\r\nTo minimize bias, researchers should:\r\n- Use appropriate sampling techniques\r\n- Ensure clear and unambiguous questions or instructions\r\n- Blind observers to the purpose of the study when possible\r\n- Use standardized procedures and instruments\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n\r\n### Example 1: Determining Sample Size\r\nA researcher wants to estimate the proportion of students in a school who prefer football to basketball. The school has 1,200 students. If the researcher wants a margin of error of 5% with a 95% confidence level, what sample size should be used?\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n- Population size: 1,200 students\r\n- Margin of error (e): 0.05\r\n- Confidence level: 95% (z-score = 1.96)\r\n- Expected proportion (p): 0.5 (unknown)\r\n\r\nUsing the formula: $n = \\frac{z^2 \\times p(1-p)}{e^2}$\r\n\r\n$n = \\frac{1.96^2 \\times 0.5(1-0.5)}{0.05^2} = 384.16$\r\n\r\nRounding up, the researcher should use a sample size of at least 385 students.\r\n\r\n### Example 2: Stratified Sampling\r\nA mobile money company wants to survey its customers to determine their satisfaction with the service. The company has 10,000 customers, of which 6,000 are male and 4,000 are female. If the company wants a sample size of 500, how many male and female customers should be surveyed?\r\n\r\nTo ensure representative sampling, we use stratified sampling based on gender.\r\n\r\nMale customers: $\\frac{6,000}{10,000} \\times 500 = 300$\r\nFemale customers: $\\frac{4,000}{10,000} \\times 500 = 200$\r\n\r\nTherefore, the company should survey 300 male customers and 200 female customers.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: Pie chart showing the proportions of male and female customers in the sample]\r\n\r\n### Example 3: Identifying Bias\r\nA researcher conducted a survey to determine the average monthly income of workers in a city. The researcher stood outside a luxury shopping mall and asked 100 shoppers about their income.\r\n\r\nIdentify the potential source of bias in this study.\r\n\r\nThe potential source of bias is sampling bias. By surveying only shoppers at a luxury mall, the researcher is likely to oversample high-income individuals, leading to an overestimation of the average monthly income in the city. To obtain a more representative sample, the researcher should use a random sampling method that includes a diverse range of locations and individuals.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. A farmer wants to estimate the average weight of the watermelons in his field. If he wants a margin of error of 2 kg with a 90% confidence level, and the expected standard deviation is 5 kg, what sample size should he use? (Answer: 51 watermelons)\r\n\r\n2. A school has 500 students, of which 200 are in JHS 1, 150 in JHS 2, and 150 in JHS 3. If a sample of 60 students is needed for a survey, how many students should be selected from each grade level using stratified sampling? (Answer: JHS 1: 24, JHS 2: 18, JHS 3: 18)\r\n\r\n3. A researcher wants to determine the proportion of households in a village that have access to electricity. The researcher surveys 50 households near the village center and finds that 90% have electricity. What is a potential source of bias in this study? (Answer: Sampling bias, as households near the village center may not be representative of the entire village)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- Data collection involves gathering information through surveys, observational studies, or experiments.\r\n- Sampling techniques, such as simple random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling, are used to select representative subsets of a population.\r\n- Sample size is determined by the desired margin of error, confidence level, and expected proportion or standard deviation.\r\n- Bias can occur due to sampling issues, response inaccuracies, or observer prejudice, and should be minimized through appropriate sampling, clear instructions, and standardized procedures.\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n| Term/Formula | Meaning/Use |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| Population   | The entire group of individuals or objects of interest |\r\n| Sample       | A subset of the population selected for study |\r\n| Margin of error | The maximum expected difference between sample results and true population values |\r\n| $n = \\frac{z^2 \\times p(1-p)}{e^2}$ | Formula for determining sample size based on margin of error and confidence level |\r\n| Stratified sampling | Dividing the population into subgroups (strata) and sampling from each stratum |\r\n| Cluster sampling | Dividing the population into clusters and randomly selecting a sample of clusters |\r\n| Bias         | A systematic error that leads to inaccurate or misleading results |",

Understand the concept of a frequency table and its components\r\n2. Collect data and organize it into a frequency table\r\n3. Calculate the total frequency and relative frequency for each category\r\n4. Interpret and analyze data presented in a frequency table\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we often deal with large amounts of data, whether it's the prices of different items at the market, the number of mobile money transactions we make, or the crop yields on a farm. As Ghanaian students preparing for the BECE, it's essential to understand how to organize and interpret this data effectively. One powerful tool for achieving this is the frequency table.\r\n\r\nFrequency tables allow us to summarize data by grouping it into categories and counting the number of occurrences in each category. By learning how to create and analyze frequency tables, you'll be better equipped to make sense of the data you encounter in your studies and everyday life, setting you up for success in your BECE exams and beyond.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### What is a Frequency Table?\r\nA **frequency table** is a way of organizing and summarizing data by grouping it into categories and counting the number of occurrences (or frequency) in each category. The table consists of two main columns:\r\n1. The **category** or **class** column, which lists the different groups or intervals into which the data is divided\r\n2. The **frequency** column, which shows the number of data points that fall into each category\r\n\r\n### Creating a Frequency Table\r\nTo create a frequency table, follow these steps:\r\n1. Collect the data you want to organize\r\n2. Identify the categories or classes into which you will group the data\r\n3. Count the number of data points that fall into each category\r\n4. Record the counts in the frequency column of the table\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you surveyed 20 students about the number of hours they spend studying for the BECE each week. The data you collected is as follows:\r\n```\r\n3, 5, 2, 6, 4, 3, 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 5, 4, 3, 7\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo create a frequency table, you might group the data into the following categories:\r\n- 1-2 hours\r\n- 3-4 hours\r\n- 5-6 hours\r\n- 7-8 hours\r\n\r\nCounting the number of students in each category, you would get the following frequency table:\r\n\r\n| Hours Studying per Week | Frequency |\r\n|-------------------------|-----------|\r\n| 1-2                     | 2         |\r\n| 3-4                     | 8         |\r\n| 5-6                     | 8         |\r\n| 7-8                     | 2         |\r\n\r\n### Calculating Total Frequency and Relative Frequency\r\nThe **total frequency** is the sum of all the frequencies in the table. In the example above, the total frequency is:\r\n```\r\n2 + 8 + 8 + 2 = 20\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **relative frequency** for each category is the frequency of that category divided by the total frequency. It represents the proportion or percentage of data points in each category. To calculate the relative frequency, use the following formula:\r\n```\r\nRelative Frequency = Frequency ÷ Total Frequency\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the \"3-4 hours\" category in the example, the relative frequency would be:\r\n```\r\nRelative Frequency = 8 ÷ 20 = 0.4 or 40%\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the updated frequency table with the relative frequencies:\r\n\r\n| Hours Studying per Week | Frequency | Relative Frequency |\r\n|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------|\r\n| 1-2                     | 2         | 0.1 or 10%        |\r\n| 3-4                     | 8         | 0.4 or 40%        |\r\n| 5-6                     | 8         | 0.4 or 40%        |\r\n| 7-8                     | 2         | 0.1 or 10%        |\r\n\r\n### Interpreting Frequency Tables\r\nFrequency tables provide a clear and concise way to view the distribution of data across different categories. By examining the frequencies and relative frequencies, you can gain insights into the data, such as:\r\n- Which categories have the highest or lowest frequencies\r\n- How the data is distributed among the categories (evenly or unevenly)\r\n- What percentage of the data falls into each category\r\n\r\nIn the example above, you can see that most students (80%) spend between 3 and 6 hours studying for the BECE each week, with an equal number of students in the \"3-4 hours\" and \"5-6 hours\" categories. Only a small percentage of students (20%) fall into the extreme categories of \"1-2 hours\" and \"7-8 hours\".\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. A market trader recorded the weights (in kg) of 30 bags of rice sold in a day:\r\n```\r\n25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30, 35, 40, 25, 30\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a frequency table for the data, using intervals of 5 kg.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A frequency table with weight categories and frequencies]\r\n\r\n| Weight (kg) | Frequency |\r\n|-------------|-----------|\r\n| 25-29       | 9         |\r\n| 30-34       | 9         |\r\n| 35-39       | 9         |\r\n| 40-44       | 3         |\r\n\r\nTo create the frequency table:\r\n1. Group the data into intervals of 5 kg: 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and 40-44\r\n2. Count the number of bags in each weight category\r\n3. Record the frequencies in the table\r\n\r\n2. A teacher recorded the scores of 40 students on a BECE practice test out of 100 marks. The scores were as follows:\r\n```\r\n85, 92, 78, 60, 88, 75, 90, 82, 65, 98, 72, 80, 95, 68, 87, 62, 93, 77, 58, 89, 73, 84, 91, 67, 96, 70, 83, 94, 63, 86, 76, 81, 97, 71, 90, 69, 79, 88, 74, 66\r\n```\r\n\r\na) Create a frequency table for the scores using the following intervals: 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-99.\r\nb) Calculate the relative frequencies for each interval.\r\n\r\na) [IMAGE: A frequency table with score intervals and frequencies]\r\n\r\n| Score Interval | Frequency |\r\n|----------------|-----------|\r\n| 50-59          | 1         |\r\n| 60-69          | 8         |\r\n| 70-79          | 11        |\r\n| 80-89          | 12        |\r\n| 90-99          | 8         |\r\n\r\nb) To calculate the relative frequencies, divide each frequency by the total number of students (40):\r\n\r\n| Score Interval | Frequency | Relative Frequency           |\r\n|----------------|-----------|------------------------------|\r\n| 50-59          | 1         | 1 ÷ 40 = 0.025 or 2.5%       |\r\n| 60-69          | 8         | 8 ÷ 40 = 0.2 or 20%          |\r\n| 70-79          | 11        | 11 ÷ 40 = 0.275 or 27.5%     |\r\n| 80-89          | 12        | 12 ÷ 40 = 0.3 or 30%         |\r\n| 90-99          | 8         | 8 ÷ 40 = 0.2 or 20%          |\r\n\r\n3. A mobile money agent recorded the number of transactions processed each day for a week:\r\n```\r\nMonday: 120\r\nTuesday: 95\r\nWednesday: 105\r\nThursday: 110\r\nFriday: 125\r\nSaturday: 140\r\nSunday: 80\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a frequency table for the data.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A frequency table with days and frequencies]\r\n\r\n| Day       | Frequency |\r\n|-----------|-----------|\r\n| Monday    | 120       |\r\n| Tuesday   | 95        |\r\n| Wednesday | 105       |\r\n| Thursday  | 110       |\r\n| Friday    | 125       |\r\n| Saturday  | 140       |\r\n| Sunday    | 80        |\r\n\r\nSince each day has a unique frequency, there's no need to group the data into intervals. Simply list the days and their corresponding frequencies in the table.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. A farmer recorded the number of eggs collected from his chickens each day for a week:\r\n```\r\n35, 28, 32, 30, 36, 29, 33\r\n```\r\nCreate a frequency table for the data, using intervals of 5 eggs.\r\n\r\n2. A teacher recorded the heights (in cm) of 25 students in her class:\r\n```\r\n142, 138, 150, 146, 139, 152, 144, 148, 137, 145, 140, 149, 143, 151, 141, 147, 136, 153, 139, 150, 144, 148, 142, 146, 140\r\n```\r\na) Create a frequency table for the heights using the following intervals: 135-139, 140-144, 145-149, 150-154.\r\nb) Calculate the relative frequencies for each interval.\r\n\r\n3. The number of customers visiting a shop each day for a week was recorded as follows:\r\n```\r\nMonday: 50\r\nTuesday: 35\r\nWednesday: 45\r\nThursday: 55\r\nFriday: 60\r\nSaturday: 70\r\nSunday: 40\r\n```\r\nCreate a frequency table for the data and calculate the relative frequencies for each day.\r\n\r\n(Answers at the end)\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- A frequency table organizes data into categories and counts the number of occurrences in each category\r\n- To create a frequency table, collect data, identify categories, count the occurrences in each category, and record the frequencies\r\n- The total frequency is the sum of all frequencies in the table\r\n- Relative frequency is the proportion of data in each category, calculated by dividing the frequency by the total frequency\r\n- Frequency tables help you understand the distribution of data and identify patterns or trends\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n\r\n| Term/Formula                                             | Meaning/Use                                                                        |\r\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| Frequency Table                                          | A table that organizes data into categories and counts the occurrences in each    |\r\n| Category or Class                                        | A group or interval into which data is divided                                    |\r\n| Frequency                                                | The number of data points that fall into a category                               |\r\n| Total Frequency                                          | The sum of all frequencies in a table                                             |\r\n| Relative Frequency                                       | The proportion of data in a category (frequency ÷ total frequency)                |\r\n| Relative Frequency = Frequency ÷ Total Frequency         | Formula to calculate relative frequency                                           |\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnswers to Practice Problems:\r\n1. \r\n| Eggs per Day | Frequency |\r\n|--------------|-----------|\r\n| 25-29        | 2         |\r\n| 30-34        | 4         |\r\n| 35-39        | 1         |\r\n\r\n2. \r\na)\r\n| Height (cm) | Frequency |\r\n|-------------|-----------|\r\n| 135-139     | 5         |\r\n| 140-144     | 8         |\r\n| 145-149     | 7         |\r\n| 150-154     | 5         |\r\n\r\nb)\r\n| Height (cm) | Frequency | Relative Frequency |\r\n|-------------|-----------|-------------------|\r\n| 135-139     | 5         | 0.2 or 20%        |\r\n| 140-144     | 8         | 0.32 or 32%       |\r\n| 145-149     | 7         | 0.28 or 28%       |\r\n| 150-154     | 5         | 0.2 or 20%        |\r\n\r\n3. \r\n| Day       | Frequency | Relative Frequency |\r\n|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\r\n| Monday    | 50        | 0.141 or 14.1%    |\r\n| Tuesday   | 35        | 0.099 or 9.9%     |\r\n| Wednesday | 45        | 0.127 or 12.7%    |\r\n| Thursday  | 55        | 0.155 or 15.5%    |\r\n| Friday    | 60        | 0.169 or 16.9%    |\r\n| Saturday  | 70        | 0.197 or 19.7%    |\r\n| Sunday    | 40        | 0.113 or 11.3%    |",

Solve real-world problems involving data representation\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we often encounter information presented in various forms, such as charts and graphs. Understanding how to interpret and create these visual representations of data is a crucial skill, not only for succeeding in the BECE exams but also for making informed decisions in real life.\r\n\r\nImagine you are helping your parents at their market stall, and you want to keep track of the number of different fruits sold each day. By creating a bar chart or pictogram, you can easily visualize which fruits are the most popular and make decisions about what to stock more of in the future. Similarly, when managing your mobile money account, you might want to see a graph of your expenses over time to better understand your spending habits.\r\n\r\nAs you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering the concepts of bar charts and pictograms will help you tackle questions related to data representation and interpretation with confidence. So, let's dive in and explore these essential mathematical tools!\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n\r\n### What are Bar Charts and Pictograms?\r\n**Bar charts** and **pictograms** are graphical representations of data that use bars or pictures to show the frequencies or values of different categories. They are used to compare and display data in a clear and visually appealing way.\r\n\r\nIn a bar chart, each category is represented by a rectangular bar, and the height or length of the bar is proportional to the value or frequency of that category. The bars can be vertical or horizontal, and they should be of equal width with equal spacing between them.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A vertical bar chart showing the number of different fruits sold at a market stall over a week. The categories (fruits) are on the x-axis, and the frequencies (number sold) are on the y-axis.]\r\n\r\nA pictogram, also known as a pictograph, uses pictures or symbols to represent data. Each picture or symbol corresponds to a specific value, and the number of pictures or symbols used for each category represents the frequency or value of that category.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A pictogram showing the number of students who prefer different subjects. Each student icon represents 10 students, and the subjects are listed on the left side of the pictogram.]\r\n\r\n### Interpreting Bar Charts and Pictograms\r\nTo interpret a bar chart or pictogram, follow these steps:\r\n1. Read the title and labels to understand what data is being represented.\r\n2. Identify the categories on the x-axis (horizontal axis) and the frequencies or values on the y-axis (vertical axis).\r\n3. In a pictogram, determine the value represented by each picture or symbol.\r\n4. Compare the heights of the bars or the number of pictures/symbols to determine which categories have the highest or lowest values.\r\n5. Look for any patterns, trends, or differences between the categories.\r\n\r\n### Constructing Bar Charts and Pictograms\r\nTo create a bar chart or pictogram, follow these steps:\r\n1. Gather the data you want to represent and organize it into categories and frequencies or values.\r\n2. Choose an appropriate scale for the y-axis (bar chart) or the value represented by each picture/symbol (pictogram). The scale should be consistent and easy to read.\r\n3. Label the x-axis with the categories and the y-axis with the frequencies or values.\r\n4. Draw the bars or add the pictures/symbols for each category according to the scale.\r\n5. Add a title and any necessary labels or legends to make the chart easy to understand.\r\n\r\n### Choosing Appropriate Scales\r\nWhen creating a bar chart or pictogram, it is important to choose an appropriate scale. The scale should:\r\n- Be consistent throughout the chart\r\n- Start at zero (for bar charts)\r\n- Have evenly spaced intervals\r\n- Be easy to read and interpret\r\n- Fit the data well without too much empty space or overcrowding\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are creating a bar chart showing the weights of different fruits in kilograms, you might use a scale that goes up by 0.5 kg intervals (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, etc.).\r\n\r\n| Fruit   | Weight (kg) |\r\n|---------|-------------|\r\n| Apple   | 0.2         |\r\n| Banana  | 0.1         |\r\n| Orange  | 0.3         |\r\n| Pineapple | 1.5       |\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A bar chart showing the weights of different fruits using a scale that starts at 0 and goes up by 0.5 kg intervals.]\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n\r\n### Example 1: Interpreting a Bar Chart\r\nThe bar chart below shows the number of textbooks sold at a bookshop over five days.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A vertical bar chart with the following data:\r\n- Monday: 25 textbooks\r\n- Tuesday: 40 textbooks \r\n- Wednesday: 35 textbooks\r\n- Thursday: 20 textbooks\r\n- Friday: 30 textbooks]\r\n\r\na) How many textbooks were sold on Wednesday?\r\n   * From the bar chart, we can see that on Wednesday, 35 textbooks were sold.\r\n\r\nb) On which day were the most textbooks sold?\r\n   * By comparing the heights of the bars, we can see that the tallest bar corresponds to Tuesday, which means the most textbooks (40) were sold on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nc) How many more textbooks were sold on Friday than on Thursday?\r\n   * Thursday: 20 textbooks sold\r\n   * Friday: 30 textbooks sold\r\n   * Difference = 30 - 20 = 10 textbooks\r\n   * Therefore, 10 more textbooks were sold on Friday than on Thursday.\r\n\r\n### Example 2: Constructing a Pictogram\r\nCreate a pictogram to represent the following data about the number of students who prefer different subjects:\r\n- Mathematics: 40 students\r\n- Science: 30 students \r\n- English: 20 students\r\n- Social Studies: 50 students\r\n\r\nLet each student icon represent 10 students.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Determine the number of icons needed for each subject.\r\n- Mathematics: 40 ÷ 10 = 4 icons\r\n- Science: 30 ÷ 10 = 3 icons\r\n- English: 20 ÷ 10 = 2 icons  \r\n- Social Studies: 50 ÷ 10 = 5 icons\r\n\r\nStep 2: Draw the pictogram with the appropriate number of icons for each subject.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A pictogram with the following data:\r\n- Mathematics: 4 student icons\r\n- Science: 3 student icons\r\n- English: 2 student icons\r\n- Social Studies: 5 student icons\r\nInclude a key showing that each student icon represents 10 students.]\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. The table below shows the number of different types of vehicles sold at a car dealership in a month. Create a bar chart to represent this data.\r\n\r\n| Vehicle Type | Number Sold |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| Sedan        | 50          |\r\n| SUV          | 30          |\r\n| Truck        | 20          |\r\n| Van          | 10          |\r\n\r\n2. A pictogram is shown below representing the number of different types of crops harvested on a farm. Each tractor icon represents 100 tons of crops. How many tons of each crop were harvested?\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: A pictogram with the following data:\r\n- Maize: 4 tractor icons\r\n- Rice: 2 tractor icons  \r\n- Yam: 3 tractor icons\r\n- Cassava: 5 tractor icons]\r\n\r\n3.

[IMAGE: A correctly constructed bar chart with appropriate labels, scale, and title.]\r\n2. Maize: 400 tons, Rice: 200 tons, Yam: 300 tons, Cassava: 500 tons\r\n3. a) Week 4, b) GH₵400\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n- Bar charts and pictograms are visual representations of data using bars or pictures.\r\n- To interpret a bar chart or pictogram, read the title, labels, and scales to understand the data being represented.\r\n- When constructing a bar chart or pictogram, choose an appropriate scale, label the axes, and draw the bars or pictures according to the data.\r\n- Bar charts and pictograms are useful for comparing data and identifying patterns or trends.\r\n- Solving real-world problems involving data representation requires careful interpretation and analysis of bar charts and pictograms.\r\n\r\n## Key Vocabulary/Formulas\r\n\r\n| Term/Formula | Meaning/Use |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| Bar chart    | A graphical representation of data using rectangular bars to show frequencies or values of different categories |\r\n| Pictogram    | A graphical representation of data using pictures or symbols to show frequencies or values of different categories |\r\n| Scale        | The system of numbers or values used to measure or represent data on an axis |\r\n| Frequency    | The number of times a value or category occurs in a dataset |\r\n| x-axis       | The horizontal axis in a graph, usually representing categories or variables |\r\n| y-axis       | The vertical axis in a graph, usually representing frequencies or values |",

Calculate the mean of a set of numbers\r\n2. Find the median value in a dataset\r\n3. Determine the mode or modal class of a frequency distribution\r\n4. Interpret and compare mean, median and mode in real-world contexts\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nStatistics play a crucial role in our daily lives as Ghanaians. From calculating the average price of goods at the market to analyzing mobile money transaction data, understanding statistical measures is essential. For farmers, statistics help in estimating crop yields and making informed decisions. As you prepare for the BECE exams, mastering the concepts of mean, median, and mode will not only boost your mathematical skills but also enable you to solve real-world problems effectively.\r\n\r\nIn this section, we will explore these three measures of central tendency in detail. We will learn how to calculate them, interpret their meanings, and apply them to various scenarios. By the end of this section, you will have a solid foundation in statistics that will serve you well in your future studies and beyond.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n### Mean\r\nThe **mean** is the arithmetic average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the total number of values. The formula for the mean is:\r\n\r\n$\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$\r\n\r\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the mean, $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$ represents the sum of all values, and $n$ is the total number of values.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the mean:\r\n1. Add up all the values in the dataset\r\n2. Divide the sum by the total number of values\r\n\r\nFor example, to find the mean of the numbers 4, 7, 9, and 12:\r\n1. Add the numbers: 4 + 7 + 9 + 12 = 32\r\n2. Divide by the total count: 32 ÷ 4 = 8\r\n\r\nTherefore, the mean is 8.\r\n\r\n### Median\r\nThe **median** is the middle value in a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\r\n\r\nTo find the median:\r\n1. Arrange the values in ascending or descending order\r\n2. If the number of values is odd, the median is the middle value\r\n3. If the number of values is even, the median is the average of the two middle values\r\n\r\nFor example, to find the median of the numbers 4, 7, 9, and 12:\r\n1. Arrange in ascending order: 4, 7, 9, 12\r\n2. There are 4 values (even), so the median is the average of the two middle values (7 and 9)\r\n   - Median = (7 + 9) ÷ 2 = 8\r\n\r\nTherefore, the median is 8.\r\n\r\n### Mode\r\nThe **mode** is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes.\r\n\r\nTo determine the mode:\r\n1. Identify the value or values that occur most often in the dataset\r\n2. If no value appears more than once, there is no mode\r\n3. If two or more values appear with the same highest frequency, they are all modes\r\n\r\nFor example, in the dataset 4, 7, 9, 12, 7, each value appears once except for 7, which appears twice. Therefore, the mode is 7.\r\n\r\n### Comparing Mean, Median, and Mode\r\n[IMAGE: A diagram showing the relationship between mean, median, and mode in a symmetrical distribution and a skewed distribution]\r\n\r\nThe mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency, but they provide different information about a dataset:\r\n- The mean is affected by extreme values and is a good representation of the dataset when the data is symmetrically distributed\r\n- The median is less affected by extreme values and is a better measure when the data is skewed\r\n- The mode represents the most common value and is useful for categorical or discrete data\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n1. The weights (in kg) of 5 bags of rice at a market are: 50, 52, 48, 51, 49. Calculate the mean weight.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Sum of weights = 50 + 52 + 48 + 51 + 49 = 250\r\n- Number of bags = 5\r\n- Mean weight = 250 ÷ 5 = 50 kg\r\n\r\nTherefore, the mean weight of the rice bags is 50 kg.\r\n\r\n2. The monthly mobile money transactions (in GH₵) for a small business are: 150, 200, 175, 225, 180, 190. Find the median transaction amount.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- Arrange the values in ascending order: 150, 175, 180, 190, 200, 225\r\n- There are 6 values (even), so the median is the average of the two middle values (180 and 190)\r\n- Median = (180 + 190) ÷ 2 = 185\r\n\r\nTherefore, the median monthly transaction amount is GH₵185.\r\n\r\n3. The number of mangoes harvested from 10 trees in a farmer's orchard are: 25, 30, 28, 30, 32, 27, 29, 30, 31, 28. Determine the mode of the dataset.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n- The value that appears most frequently is 30, appearing 3 times\r\n- No other value appears more than twice\r\n\r\nTherefore, the mode of the mango harvest dataset is 30.\r\n\r\n## Practice Problems\r\n1. The scores of 7 students on a BECE practice test are: 75, 80, 85, 90, 78, 82, 88. Calculate the mean score.\r\n\r\n2. The daily sales (in GH₵) at a market stall for a week are: 120, 150, 130, 140, 160, 145, 135. Find the median daily sales.\r\n\r\n3. The number of eggs laid by 12 chickens in a day are: 4, 5, 6, 4, 5, 3, 4, 6, 5, 4, 5, 4. Determine the mode of the dataset.\r\n\r\nAnswers:\r\n1. 82.57\r\n2.

          "content": "## Learning Objectives\r\nBy the end of this section, students will be able to:\r\n1. Interpret and analyze data presented in tables and charts\r\n2. Calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)\r\n3. Understand and compute the range of a dataset\r\n4. Draw and interpret bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs\r\n5. Solve real-life problems involving data analysis and interpretation\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nIn our daily lives, we often encounter various forms of data, whether it's the prices of goods at the market, the amount of mobile money transactions, or the yields from a farm. Being able to interpret and analyze this data is a crucial skill that can help us make informed decisions. For instance, a farmer in Ghana might want to know the average yield of their crops over the past few years to plan for the future. Similarly, understanding how to interpret graphs and charts can be invaluable when preparing for the BECE exams, as these questions often appear in the mathematics section.\r\n\r\nAs we delve into the world of statistics, we will learn how to make sense of data, calculate important measures, and represent information visually. By mastering these concepts, you will not only be better prepared for your exams but also develop essential skills that will serve you well in your future careers and personal lives.\r\n\r\n## Main Content\r\n\r\n### Types of Data\r\nThere are two main types of data:\r\n1. **Qualitative data**: This type of data describes qualities or characteristics, such as colors, categories, or names. For example, the types of crops grown on a farm (e.g., maize, yam, cassava) are qualitative data.\r\n2. **Quantitative data**: This type of data is numerical and can be measured or counted. For example, the weights of bags of rice in kilograms or the amount of money earned from selling goods are quantitative data.\r\n\r\n### Measures of Central Tendency\r\nMeasures of central tendency help us describe the typical or central value in a dataset. The three main measures are:\r\n\r\n1. **Mean**: The arithmetic average of a set of numbers, calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values.\r\n\r\n   $\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\text{Sum of all values}}{\\text{Number of values}}$\r\n\r\n2. **Median**: The middle value when the data is arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\r\n\r\n3. **Mode**: The value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have no mode, one mode, or multiple modes.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following dataset representing the ages of students in a class:\r\n14, 15, 14, 16, 15, 14, 15, 16, 14, 15\r\n\r\n- The mean age is $\\frac{14 + 15 + 14 + 16 + 15 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 14 + 15}{10} = 14.8$ years\r\n- The median age is 15 years (the average of the two middle values, 15 and 15)\r\n- The mode is 14 years (appears most frequently)\r\n\r\n### Range\r\nThe **range** is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It provides a measure of how spread out the data is.\r\n\r\n$\\text{Range} = \\text{Largest value} - \\text{Smallest value}$\r\n\r\nFor the age dataset above, the range is $16 - 14 = 2$ years.\r\n\r\n### Graphical Representations of Data\r\n\r\nData can be represented visually using various types of graphs and charts, such as:\r\n\r\n1. **Bar graphs**: Used to compare categories or discrete values. The height of each bar represents the frequency or value of the corresponding category.\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: A bar graph showing the number of students in each grade level (JHS 1, JHS 2, JHS 3) at a school in Ghana]\r\n\r\n2. **Pie charts**: Used to show the proportion or percentage of each category in a whole. Each slice of the pie represents a category, and the size of the slice is proportional to its percentage of the total.\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: A pie chart showing the distribution of crops (maize, yam, cassava, others) grown on a farm in Ghana]\r\n\r\n3. **Line graphs**: Used to display trends or changes over time. The independent variable (usually time) is on the x-axis, and the dependent variable (the value being measured) is on the y-axis.\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: A line graph showing the change in the price of a bag of cement in Ghana over a 6-month period]\r\n\r\n## Worked Examples\r\n\r\n1. The table below shows the distribution of mobile money transactions in a small Ghanaian town over a week:\r\n\r\n   | Day       | Number of Transactions |\r\n   |-----------|------------------------|\r\n   | Monday    | 25                     |\r\n   | Tuesday   | 30                     |\r\n   | Wednesday | 28                     |\r\n   | Thursday  | 35                     |\r\n   | Friday    | 40                     |\r\n   | Saturday  | 45                     |\r\n   | Sunday    | 20                     |\r\n\r\n   Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the number of transactions.\r\n\r\n   **Solution:**\r\n   \r\n   To find the mean, add up all the values and divide by the number of days:\r\n   $\\text{Mean} = \\frac{25 + 30 + 28 + 35 + 40 + 45 + 20}{7} = \\frac{223}{7} = 31.86$\r\n   \r\n   To find the median, arrange the values in ascending order:\r\n   20, 25, 28, 30, 35, 40, 45\r\n   The median is the middle value, which is 30.\r\n   \r\n   To find the mode, look for the value that appears most frequently. In this case, each value appears only once, so there is no mode.\r\n\r\n2. The weights (in kg) of 10 bags of rice are: 50, 52, 48, 50, 51, 49, 52, 50, 51, 47. Find the range of the weights.\r\n\r\n   **Solution:**\r\n   \r\n   To find the range, subtract the smallest value from the largest value:\r\n   \r\n   Largest value: 52 kg\r\n   Smallest value: 47 kg\r\n   $\\text{Range} = 52 - 47 = 5$ kg\r\n\r\n3. A farmer in Ghana recorded the number of eggs collected from their chicken coop over a period of 5 days: 15, 18, 20, 16, 19. Draw a bar graph to represent this data.\r\n\r\n   **Solution:**\r\n\r\n   [IMAGE: A bar graph with the days (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) on the x-axis and the number of eggs on the y-axis.
