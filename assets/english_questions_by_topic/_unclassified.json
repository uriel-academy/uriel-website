      "questionText": "Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow.\n\n \n\nCholera is a very dangerous disease which can kill many people within a short time. Indeed, it has ruined several communities particularly in the developing countries. It must therefore be prevented at all cost.\n\n \n\nThe disease is general spread by germs which thrive in filthy and unhygienic areas. There could be an outbreak of cholera when drinking water becomes polluted by floods after a downpour. Human carriers also cause the disease to spread from place to place. For example, a person carrying the cholera germs would vomit or pass frequent stools. Flies would then carry the germs on their hairy legs and deposit them on exposed food or in water. When a person eats this contaminated food or drinks the polluted water, he or she is likely to contract the disease unknowingly.\n\n \n\nOn the whole, the main symptoms of cholera are severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which may result in loss of weight. The stool tends to be watery. As a lot of fluid is lost from the body, the patient quickly becomes dehydrated, thin and weak. The rapid loss of body fluid can soon result in death, unless the lost fluid is replaced immediately.\n\n \n\nThe first thing for the patient to do is replenish as much fluid as is lost by taking, from time to time, boiled water which has been allowed to cool and mixed with salt and sugar. Then, he should seek medical attention.\n\n \n\n(a) Where do cholera germs usually breed?\n\n \n\n(b) Mention the two main carriers of cholera germs.\n\n \n\n(c)I. State the two signs of cholera.\n\nII. Give one effect of the disease.\n\n \n\n(d) What advice does the writer give to the cholera patient?\n\n \n\n(e) Explain the following expressions in your own words:\n\nI. it has ruined several communities;\n\nII. at all cost;\n\nIII. after a downpour.\n\n \n\n(f) For each of the following words, give another word or phrase that means the same and can fit into the passage:\n\nI. thrive;\n\nII. deposit;\n\nIII. rapid;\n\nIV. replenish;\n\nV. seek.",

      "questionText": "Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow.\n\n \n\nNobody wanted Ananse to succeed in drinking the cup of hot water and win, Adiefe, the Chief's beautiful daughter.\n\n \n\nAnanse grabbed the cup of hot water, bowed as gracefully as possible and smiled confidently. He lifted the cup and said, slowly and calmly, 'Nana, look...................!' Nana Apo barked, 'yes, it's hot. Drink it right now!' But Ananse kept a cool head. Then, in the full glare of all present, he shook the cup vigorously for some time in order to cool its content. After this, he began to sip the now-lukewarm water as if it was still hot. Between the sips, the pain he seemed to be going through made him frown. He shut the left eye and his right eye shone brightly. He deliberately let his left hand drop loosely by his side.\n\n \n\nNana Apo smiled. Queen Amola grinned. Adiefe giggled-all in happy anticipation of Ananse's failure.\n\n \n\nSuddenly Ananse began to drink the warm water more quickly and noisily. Soon, all was gone. He turned the cup upside down towards Nana and, indeed, there was not a single drop in it. Lo and behold, Kweku Ananse, the notorious trickster, had succeeded where all others has failed. There was complete silence. Even the wind seemed to have stopped blowing. The impossible had happened and people's expectation that Kweku Ananse would lose the contest had failed. Eventually, Kweku Ananse's victory had won him the hand of the pretty Princess, Adiefe.\n\n \n\nNana Apo and Queen Amola, with great relunctace, led their daughter, Adiefe, and handed her over to victorious Kweku Ananse.\n\n \n\n(a) What was the attitude of the people present before the contest?\n\n \n\n(b) Why do you think Ananse shook the cup?\n\n \n\n(c) State the three tricks Ananse used to show that he was in pain.\n\n \n\n(d)I.

In one month, she could milk cows, separate butter and cheese from the milk, ferment the milk and cook nearly as well as Rikku's mother. At first, she went with Rikku's mother to hawk the sour milk, she was beginning to find her way to and from town.\n\n \n\nFatimeh was always chewing tobacco flower and so her lips, teeth and gums became red. Hodio noticed that her looks had improved since she came to live with family, her skin was smooth and shiny; she had also put on more flesh.\n\n \n\nTowards nightfall, when Fatimeh came home, she would take a pot and go down to the stream where she bathed and drew water. Sometimes, she went with Leibe or Shaitu; she was never alone.\n\n \n\nOne evening, Hodio followed Fatimeh quietly to the stream when the place was quiet and he could hear the sound of his own footsteps on the dusty road. When he caught up with Fatimeh, he suggested to her to run away with him because he loved he dearly and wanted her to be his wife. Fatimeh refused. She knew very well that, as a slave, she could never hope to marry a freeborn and proud Fulani like Hodio Sunsaye.\n\n \n\nHodio did not give up. He spoke to her again. He tried to persuade her to run away with him and live in a town where no one cared about tradition and custom. Eventually, Fatimeh agreed to consider his proposal.\n\n \n\nHodio's father, old Sunsaye, was the first person who missed Fatimeh. He called his wife, Shaitu, and asked her if she has seen Fatimeh. She replied in the negative. He asked Rikku and Leibe. No one could tell him where Hodio and Fatimeh were. They then looked behind the hut; the horse was not there.\n\n \n\n(a) What two things did the girl learn to do in one month?\n\n \n\n(b) Give two adjectives that describe Fatimeh as presented in the firdt paragraph.\n\n \n\n(c) What was HOodio's main reason for following Fatimeh to the stream?\n\n \n\n(d) Fatimeh refused.\n\nI.

The tiger is the largest member of the family. Although it is a wild animal, it is sometimes trained to assist acrobatic in entertaining people. The chectah is the fastest animal on land. It can be trained to hunt other animals. Cats are found in many homes but there are wild ones too.\n\nAlthough cats are found in many homes, man did not intentionally domesticate them. Before man learnt to grow crops and rear animals, he used to depend on plants and animals in the bush for food. When he gathered grains, which were seeds of grass, he accidentally took away the food of the rodents such as mice and rats. These followed their foods indoors. The wild cat, the natural enemy of the rats and mice, also followed the the domestic granaries\n\nCats did not eat the grains that were becoming the main source of nourishment for man. Therefore, they were encouraged to remain at home in order to get rid of the rodents. Man, also probably found out that cats were neater and quieter than dogs.\n\nWhen ships were invented and man began to trade farther, grains were very important commodities. They were used not only as provisions but as items of barter. The mice and the rats went along, once again followed by the cats.

      "questionText": "Ogboo was a very successful business man. He owned a fleet of vehicles. He was very generous and highly respected in his village. His children were very dear to him but he did not pamper them. He considered some modern gadgets dangerous, too expensive and a way of encouraging laziness among children. Therefore, no labour-saving gadgets were found in the kitchen. He insisted that food tasted better when prepared in the traditional way. He was also his children's barber.\n\nAt school, his children were the only pupils who received letters, popularly called snail mail. Akwesi, his eldest child, was always the object of ridicule among his peers. He patiently bore all the humiliation. When he completed school and his father made him manage his business, he decided to do things differently. He bought a cellular phone for his mother and equipped the house with modern gadgets. He also installed tracking devices on his father's vehicles and insisted on the drivers using mobile money transfer services. He swore the drivers to secrecy.\n\nIn an era when car snatching, drivers cheating their employers and armed robbery were the order of the day. Ogboo's transport business continued to flourish. He seemed to be insulated against theft. This amazed everyone. Soon, tongues began to wag. Ogboo was accused of possessing magical powers.

I asked my father to explain them to me. His explanation impressed me so I resolved to make them my hallmarks. I tried to be as good as my words. Anytime I was rude or showed disloyalty to someone, I promptly regretted it. Soon, loyalty and decorum became characteristic of me.\n\nHaving completed Junior High School, my uncle, Gidi, approached my father and requested that I lived with him temporarily as his children were in America in search of greener pastures. With Daddy's consent, I went and stayed with him. However, he refused to let me return to my parents after Senior High School. Why? Daddy impressed on me the value of hardwork so I lived up to expectation.\n\nUncle decided to visit his children for the best part of a year and left his mansion and other properties under the stewardship of Lugu, his security man and me due to the trust he reposed in us. This notwithstanding, Lugu suggested we connive with some miscreants to burgle Uncle Gidi's house and share the proceeds with them. Though he persistently attempted to persuade me, I never bought into that idea. Eventually, he fled the mansion sensing I might expose him as a traitor.\n\nUncle returned and heard about Lugu's plan which I did not succumb to and promised to reward me substantially. However, this never materialized until the unexpected happened. His children returned and told me that when Uncle Gidi was about to go to eternity, he instructed them to reward me with a three-bedroom house and a car.
