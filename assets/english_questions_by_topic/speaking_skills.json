      "questionText": "Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow.\n\n \n\nFriends are meant to help each other when the need arises. At school, some people develop friendly relationships which continue throughout their lives. One thing which helps people to stay together as intimate friends is the ability to communicate freely among themselves and endeavour to be each other's keeper. What destroys friendships mostly is friends being suspicious of each other. That is why a popular adage says, \"Suspicious is the bane of friendship\".\n\n \n\nPeople attend school not only because they want to make friends but also to acquire knowledge and skills for employment. Education helps people to be polished in their manners. The school prepares its students to become useful citizens.\n\n \n\nAt school, Tono was not in good books of the teachers because he behaved in an unruly manner. Initially, everyone avoided his company; he could be violent at times. Worst of all, he would refuse todo his assignment and was a habitual late comer. With the passage of time, he was subjected to strict discipline. He began to amend his ways and obey the school's rules and regulation. He realised the need to work diligently in order to have a bright future. His academic work there improved by leaps and bounds.\n\n \n\nFortune separated us. I travelled abroad for further studies. I stay away for two decades. On my return, I went to my former school for my certificate. There, I met a middle-age gentleman who also came to the office for the same purpose. I could not recognize him because time had wiped off all memories of school life. However, the names on the certificates revealed that we were classmates.\n\n \n\nAfter further discussion, Tono invited me to his business partner.\n\n \n\n(a)I. State one thing which helps people to be close.\n\n(a)II. How can friendships get destroyed?\n\n \n\n(b) Give two reasons why people go to school.\n\n \n\n(c)I. Why did people avoid Tono's company?\n\n(c)II. State Tono's reason for visiting his former school.\n\n \n\n(d) Why could the writer not recognise Tono?\n\n \n\n(e) Explain in your own words the following expressions as used in the passage:\n\n(i) was not in the good books of the teachers;\n\n(ii) with the passage of time;\n\n(iii) by leaps and bounds.\n\n \n\n(f) For each of the following words, give another word of a phrase that means the same, and can fit into the passage:\n\n(i) intimate;\n\n(ii) adage;\n\n(iii) acquire;\n\n(iv) polished;\n\n(v) initially.\n\n \n\nPART CLITERATURE[10 marks]\n\nAnswer all the questions in this part.\n\nSACKEY J.A and DARMANI L.

      "questionText": "Migration is a common practice among animals: birds, fish and human beings. Migration of human beings has both positive and negative effects on individuals in the society.\n\nWhen Bello migrated to the city, he left his wife, Aisha, an enterprising traditional career, to fend for herself and their two children. During one of his occasional visits home, his father asked him to take his wife and children to live with him in the city. Reluctantly, Bello gave in.\n\nAisha had imagined that she would be living in a neat, beautiful and comfortable house in the city. Instead, she, her husband and their children were accomodated in a single room. Washroom facilities were shared with other families. To worsen her plight, her housekeeping allowance was so meagre that she could hardly feed her family properly. She wanted to work, but like the other female migrants, she could not find any job. She wondered how they would survive, be able to send money to their parents and save for a rainy day.\n\nOne day, she decided to give her husband a treat and also socialize with their friends. She prepared one of the most inexpensive but tasty delicacies of her people and shared it with her neighbours. Even passers-by popped in for a bite. It was a very successful get together. Her labour was not in vain. Soon, other women asked her to teach them how to cook some local dishes. She also provided catering services at many events. She was handsomely rewarded. Gradually, Aisha Catering Services became a household name and there was remarkable improvement in their lives.\n\n(a)\n\n \n\nWhat was Aisha's occupation before she went to the city?\n\n(b)\n\n \n\nIn which two ways did migrant workers spend their money?\n\n(c)\n\n \n\nIn one adjective, describe how Aisha felt when she arrived in the city.\n\n(d)\n\n \n\n\"Reluctantly, Bello gave in\"\n\nWhy was Bello reluctant?\n\n(e)\n\n \n\nExplain in your own words the following expressions as used in the passage:\n\n(i)\n\n \n\n... to fend for;\n\n(ii)\n\n \n\nsave for a rainy day;\n\n(iii)\n\n \n\nwas not in vain.\n\n(f)\n\n \n\nFor each of the following words, give another word or phrase that means the same and can fit into the passage:\n\n(i)\n\n \n\noccasional;\n\n(ii)\n\n \n\nprepared;\n\n(iii)\n\n \n\nhandsomely;\n\n(iv)\n\n \n\nimprovement.\n\n(g)\n\n \n\nIn two sentences of not more than ten words each, summarize two problems that migrants face as expressed in the third paragraph.\n\n   \n\nPART CLITERATURE[10 marks]\n\nAnswer all the questions in this part.\n\nSACKEY J.A and DARMANI L.
