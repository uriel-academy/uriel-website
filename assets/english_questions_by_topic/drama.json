      "questionText": "Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow.\n\n \n\nWhen I was about eleven years old, I was unable to stay at one place for long; I was always on the move. Many people thought and said I was troublesome. Prominent among those who described me as such was my aunt, Araba Oboshea.\n\n \n\nAunt Araba was particularly mean. She would sit on her stool under the gum tree in front of the house and wait for me to return from wherever i had gone. As soon as I arrived she would call me and, without asking me any question or telling me anything, take my left ear between the forefinger and the thumb of her right hand and give my ear a silence, violent twist. I cannot describe the pain I endured. She would do the same to my right ear. She explained that she was paying for my absence that I had sold to her! Aunt Araba would continue to twist both ears of mine simultaneously with her forefingers and thumbs.\n\n \n\nI would scream silently, gritting my teeth so that I could not not utter any sound because of pain. That way I was spared the next stage of being given countless strokes of any stick she could lay hands on. One strange thing about Aunt Araba was that she would never hit me with her hands.\n\n \n\nAunt Araba went on treating me this way because she could hardly understand why I was always on the move. I could also not have the courage to explain why it was so because I was afraid of her and began to hate her.\n\n \n\nOn Thursday evening when I was going through my usual ordeal, an elderly man, Agya Manu who usually visited her appeared on the scene. He pleaded with her to leave me, and asked for the reason for such punishment. After he had been told my 'sin', Agya Manu, who knew me very well, explained to my auntie that I was always on the move not because I was in any bad company, but because I was the favourite for the errand. I had been running several errands for him and many other people. Agya Manu then advised me not to spend all my time running errands for others but rather, do all my duties at home.\n\n \n\n(a) What was the writer's behaviour when he was about eleven years old?\n\n \n\n(b) ..................I was always on the move.\n\nWhat is the meaning of this expression?\n\n \n\n(c) From the passage, what is the character of Aunt Araba?\n\n \n\n(d) Why did Aunt Araba keep punishing the writer?\n\n \n\n(e) How did Agya Manu rescue the writer?\n\n \n\n(f) For each of the following words, give one word or phrase which means the same:\n\nI. endured;\n\nII. countless.",

Kofi could hardly recognize Ali when the letter entered the former's office.\n\n \n\n'So you can't recognize me, Kofi, your classmate, Sikakrom J.H.S? Does money blind people and erase their memory?

Please, sit down. What can I do for you?\n\n \n\nAli reluctantly sat down. He admired Kofi's tidy office and person - the well-groomed hair, the attractive shirt and tie. Ali removed a small bottle from the breast pocket of his dust-covered shirt, poured out some white substance in his palm and sniffed it greedily.\n\n \n\nKofi noticed all that but suppressed his anger. 'I learn that luck has given you great wealth, Kofi' Ali said. 'Indeed, some people are lucky!' he added, and pulled out a crumpled cigarette and a box of matches.\n\n \n\n'I'd rather you didn't come smoke here. I keep my air fresh,' Kofi politely ordered. Ali was shocked. 'Hei, Kofi, what a complete change! What bird must have lent you is wings for you to soar so high? Oh, Luck, you can really change people!

      "questionText": "Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow.\n\n \n\nOne major cause of environment degradation in Ghana is gold mining. In the name of natural resource development, land is given to mining companies owned by foreigners. These foreigners milk the country dry and destroy the heritage of the people.\n\n \n\nFrom the vast concessions granted them by the government, they extract the gold, destroy the rivers and other water bodies in the communities before going home, leaving the land worthless. Yet their operations are legal.\n\n \n\nApproved mining is, however, not the sole gold mining activity. There is also what is regarded as unauthorized mining, called galamsey. In this enterprise, adventurous Ghanaians set out to do private mining as a livelihood. They dig up the earth with tools that are not as sophisticated as those of foreigners who also dig for the precious metal.\n\n \n\nMining activities destroy the environment. So far, it appears that nothing can be done to reclaim the land degraded by miners; the damage is irreversible. Vast tracts of arable land have become desolate mounds because of gold digging. Nothing can grow where galamsey has taken place.\n\n \n\nBesides, the main water sources of communities have been polluted by the activities of both legal and illegal miners. The gold extracted from dirt requires cleaning with chemicals and rinsing in water. By the time the gold searchers succeed in producing a glittering handful, large stretches of rivers, ponds of water and some lakes have become poisoned.\n\n \n\nPollution leaves little drinking water for man and beast. Fishes die and human contract various diseases.\n\n \n\n(a) Name the types of mining activities discussed in the passage.\n\n \n\n(b)I. Which groups of people engage in mining?\n\n(b)II. Why does government give licences to miners?\n\n \n\n(c) How are the people and the land affected by the mining activities?\n\n \n\n(d)I. How does the writer feel about mining?\n\n(d)II. Why does the writer think that nothing can be done about the effects of mining?\n\n \n\n(e) Explain the following expressions in your own words:\n\nI. milk the country dry;\n\nII. leaving the land worthless.\n\n \n\n(f) For each of the following words, give another word or phrase, that means the same, and can fit into the passage:\n\nI. vast;\n\nII. sole;\n\nIII. reclaim;\n\nIV. mounds;\n\nV. glittering.",

Its immensesize stretched as far as the eyes could see.\n\n \n\nAs the stars appeared in the sky, I ascended the hill and saw the village of my quest. I was dead with fatigue. To worsen my plight, there were blisters on my heel so I had to take a rest. But as I descended the hill, I was welcomed by the quietness of the place.\n\n \n\nThe villagers were enjoying the cool evening air. From the lagoon came the croaking of frogs. Children played and ran about excitedly. The village life was natural and simple. I sat on a bench close by. How good it was to rest!\n\n \n\nI resolved to rest on the bench. As I lay there, a sheet of mist rolled in from the sea and settled upon the village. In a few minutes, the village was filled with mist and everybody was running helter-skelter. I was drenched to the skin. I had decided to move to the next village when a woman suddenly walked up to me. For some time I had seen her gazing at me with pity. Now, as if she read my thoughts, she said, \"If you would accept my hospitality, you will be sheltered till the morning. Just charity.\" She was about thirty years of age, dressed in black with a pale face and a dark eyes.\n\n \n\nPapaye hut held special appeal for its serene environment.

      "questionText": "Read the following passage carefully and answer all the questions which follow.\n\n \n\nThe academic performance of students in the olden days was golden. Students knew the essence of education and made efforts to achieve excellence. Reading whatever material, they came across not only helped thier mental development but also made them self-reliant and confident. Students burn the midnight oil in order to make grades and to come out of the school as better people.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said of students today. Whatever students achieved in the past is considered archaic. The emergence of improver technology has bedevilled the society. Students prefer staying in touch with friends and loved ones. The use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram, has taken over their entire being. Reading useful materials like dailies, storybooks and others is now a thing of the past.\n\n \n\nThe negative influence of social media has deprived students of achieving excellence. Examination malpractices, mass failure in examination and bad language have become the order of the day.\n\n \n\nModern technology has its own benefits. In addition to serving as a great tool for businesses, it enables students to access informations easily. What is more, it enables easy interactions between friends and loved ones. As much as these are important, students should realise that, without good moral practices, education and reading, the future remains blurred. Students can eradicate the negative effects of modern technology has on them if only they remain focussed on their academic work.\n\n \n\n(a) State two benefits of reading mentioned in the passage.\n\n \n\n(b) For what two reasons did students study late into the night in the past?\n\n \n\n(c) State two benefits of modern technology.\n\n \n\n(d) How can students get rid of the harmful influence of social media?\n\n \n\n(e) Explain in your own words the following expressions as used in the passage:\n\nI. Burn the midnight oil;\n\nII. Taken over their being;\n\nIII. The order of the day.\n\n \n\n(f) For each of of the following words, give another word of a phrase that means the same, and can fit into the passage:\n\nI. golden;\n\nII. excellence;\n\nIII. archaic;\n\nIV. blurred;\n\nV. eradicate.\n\n  \n\nPART CLITERATURE[10 marks]\n\nAnswer all the questions in this part.\n\nSACKEY J.A and DARMANI L.
