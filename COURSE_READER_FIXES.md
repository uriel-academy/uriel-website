# Course Reader Fixes - October 12, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Books Tab Structure Restored
**Problem:** The entire Books page was replaced with CourseLibraryPage, removing the 3-tab structure and all storybooks.

**Solution:**
- Restored `TextbooksPage()` in `home_page.dart` 
- Added English course as a special card in the Textbooks tab
- Created `_buildEnglishCourseCard()` for grid view
- Created `_buildEnglishCourseListItem()` for list view
- Course appears as first item in both "All Books" and "Textbooks" tabs

**Result:**
```
Books Tab Structure:
├── All Books (shows textbooks + English course)
├── Textbooks (shows textbooks + English course)  ← English course added here
└── Storybooks (97 classic literature titles)
```

### 2. ✅ Reading Passages Now Display Properly
**Problem:** Content blocks with type "reading" were not being rendered, causing reading passages to be invisible.

**Solution:**
- Added `case 'reading':` to `_buildContentBlock()` switch statement
- Created `_buildReadingBlock()` method with distinctive styling:
  - Blue-tinted background (#F8F9FA)
  - Blue border with book icon
  - "Reading Passage" header
  - Larger line height (1.8) for better readability
  - Letter spacing for clarity

**Example Content Now Visible:**
```json
{
  "type": "reading",
  "title": "A Visit to Auntie Ama",
  "body": "It was Saturday afternoon when Efua visited Auntie Ama in Kasoa..."
}
```

**Location:** `lib/screens/lesson_reader_page.dart` lines 525-563

### 3. ✅ Unit Order Corrected - Revision & Assessment Last
**Problem:** Unit 10 "Revision & Assessment" was appearing as the 2nd unit instead of the last.

**Before:**
```
1. Communication and You
2. Revision & Assessment ❌ (should be last)
3. Parts of Speech I
...
9. Grammar Workshop II
```

**After:**
```
1. Communication and You
2. Parts of Speech I
3. Reading for Meaning I
4. Writing for Purpose
5. Listening & Speaking II
6. Grammar in Action
7. Poetry & Expression
8. Reading for Meaning II
9. Grammar Workshop II
10. Revision & Assessment ✅ (now last)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `assets/English_JHS_1/index_english_jhs_1.json` - Reordered units array
- Re-uploaded to Firestore via `upload_english_course.js`
