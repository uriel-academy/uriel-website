COMPREHENSIONRead the following passages carefully and answer the questions that follow.PASSAGE IMr. Kobi, the next speaker, said that although he left the school many years ago, he still remembered with thanks all that the headmaster had done to make sure that his pupils were well prepared for life. He was sorry that the headmaster had decided to retire at so early an age. This would deprive the pupils of his assistance long before it was necessary to do so. However, he wished the headmaster the best of luck in his retirement and offered him a silver tray as a sign of the high esteem in which his old pupils held him.After the tray had been handed over, the retiring headmaster came forward to make his speech of thanks. He began by giving a brief summary of the time he had spent as headmaster of the school. He added that it had always been his aim to do his best for the pupils under his charge.

PASSAGE IIIt is easy to see why television is so attractive to both children and adults. It is available in the home and we can watch it in comfort whenever we please. Besides, it provides entertainment after a day's work. Television also enables us to see places and people and their ways of life. Even people with little or no formal education can watch and enjoy the programmes.Unfortunately, television takes up much of our time. To watch it we must sit in front of it, watch as long as a programme lasts, and do little else. This exclusive aspect of television, the fact that it prevents us from doing other things, poses more serious problems than is commonly realised. While television may provide an acceptable form of relaxation for adults after a day's work, it robs children of the time they must use to learn other things. In addition, not everything that television offers is good. Even when children's programmes are provided, we are not sure that these are the only ones they will watch. In fact, these days children watch more programmes meant for adults than for them.One likely outcome of this is that children may learn about the adult world too soon, at a time when they can easily be influenced.6.
