      "content": "Once, in the world of animals, there was a great famine and the animals were dying. For about three months, Tortoise and his family had eaten very little. Tortoise's body rattled in his empty shell as he walked. One day as he thought of a way to get food, his throat began to itch.He would go to the next village where he had heard there was still some food. He would steal some for himself and his family. He took the bush path and arrived at the village after sunset. The people were preparing their meals and the smell made his mouth water.How would he get this food? Not far away from him was the village playground where there was a big hollow log leaning against a tree. This log was the drum used to summon the villagers for very important announcements. When he reached the tree he decided to climb it so that he could see the village better. Unfortunately, as he was climbing, he fell because he was very weak and hungry. His shell hit the drum, sending out a loud 'kpom! kpom!' noise.When they heard this noise, the villagers ran to the playground, believing they had been called, thereby leaving the food cooking in their homes.Very quickly Tortoise disappeared into nearby bush and ran to the village. He filled his empty shell with as much of food as he could carry and returned home.",

      "content": "n the centre of the town, the town clock chimed two o'clock. In an abandoned house on the outskirts of the town an owl hooted as if to signal to Sergeant Abora and Abaidoo to wake up from slumber.They had patrolled the town for hours and were heavy with sleep. The night was very dark and so could that in spite of his thick overcoat, the Sergeants were chattering. He was about to speak when he heard a faint sound down the road that led to the town.Abaidoo also picked the sound. Both listened attentively and realised that a late traveller was coming up the road. They took cover behind two opposing trees. As he reached where Abaidoo was hiding, the traveller stumbled over what looked like the root of tree.Then Constable Abaidoo quickly flashed his torchlight and bawled out, 'Stop or I shoot!' Abora's gun was held in readiness. The traveller who carried a heavy load on his left shoulder panicked, dropping his cutlass in the process.'Who are you? Where are you from?What's in your bag? Speak out or I shoot!We've got you at last!' Abora exclaimed.Trembling with fear and stammering for words the traveller gave his name as Nsiah. He was returning from Fosa with a bag of plantain and cassava.But his cutlass and bag, both dripping with blood, gave him away. After a search, the police found a human head and triumphantly marched him to police station.",
