## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. User Flow
```
Books Tab → Storybooks → Click Book → EPUB Reader Opens → Read & Customize
```

### 2. Technical Flow
```dart
// 1. User clicks storybook
_openStorybook(storybook) {
  // Increment read count
  _storybookService.incrementReadCount(storybook.id);
  
  // Navigate to reader
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => EpubReaderPage(
        bookTitle: storybook.title,
        author: storybook.author,
        assetPath: storybook.assetPath,
        bookId: storybook.id,
      ),
    ),
  );
}

// 2. Reader loads EPUB
final bytes = await rootBundle.load(widget.assetPath);
_epubController = EpubController(
  document: EpubDocument.openData(bytes.buffer.asUint8List()),
);

// 3. Display with customization
EpubView(
  controller: _epubController,
  builders: EpubViewBuilders<DefaultBuilderOptions>(
    options: DefaultBuilderOptions(
      textStyle: TextStyle(
        fontSize: _fontSize,
        color: _textColor,
        height: 1.6,
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

### 3. Asset Loading
- Books stored in: `assets/storybooks/*.epub`
- Loaded via: `rootBundle.load(assetPath)`
- Format: EPUB 2/3 compatible
- Size: Individual books range from 1-26 MB
