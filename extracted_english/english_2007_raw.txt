This and other noises like the banging of doors and crunching footsteps woke Barimah up. "Something must be done," he exclaimed to his wife Fosua who was already awake. He dressed up quickly, opened the door and went out advising his wife not to leave the house.It was pitch dark outside; the only light came from the flaming house of Agya Atta. By the time Barimah got there, the house was truly in flames and people had gathered around busily and frantically pouring water and sand on the flames. They were doing everything they would to put out the fire.Meanwhile, they had managed to rescue a few things from the fire. These Barimah caused to be packed and taken to his house to prevent them from being looted. He then took Agya Atta's wife and children to his house and quickly returned to fight the flames.Araba had won the hearts of many people by her good deeds and kindness.

PASSAGE IIMany smokers ignore the warning about the dangers of smoking although there is a national campaign against the habit. The United Nations has set aside a day to be observed against the killer habit.The story is told of a young man who became addicted to smoking. In no time, he developed smoking-related diseases and died miserably, leaving behind his wife and children in poverty.Research shows that the smoker is far more like to suffer, if not die of major diseases like lung cancer and heart failure, than a non-smoker.It is generally known that smoking during pregnancy is undesirable. Women who smoke produce underweight babies. They also likely to miscarry, have still-born babies or lose them after birth. If such children survive and attend school, they do not perform well.What is most annoying about smoking is the risk to passive smokers. Non-smokers breathing in smoke from other people's cigarettes, pipes and cigars stand the risk of contracting the diseases that harm smokers.If smokers knew how non-smokers fell about them, they would give up the habit.
