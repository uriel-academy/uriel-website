COMPREHENSIONRead the following passages carefully and answer the questions that follow.PASSAGE IThere stood an enormous tree in the centre of the town. Its big branches and dense foliage gave shelter in all weathers and so it had become a natural meeting place. Benches had been placed round the base of its huge trunk so that the elders of the town might sit in comfort and gossip or talk about serious affairs of the town. This particular morning, three old men were resting on one of the benches. They had chosen the side which overlooks the road entering the town. From there they could see the market, the lorry park and the Main Street.As they watched, a large bus drove into the lorry park. It was surrounded immediately by a jostling crowd. Those who whistled to travel hurried forward and food sellers rushed from all sides struggling to sell their wares. In the general uproar which followed, new passengers tried to get into the bus, whilst those who had reached their destination tried to alight. Others who were not willing to risk losing their seats stood blocking the doorway or leaned out of the bus windows so they bargained with the food sellers.1.

PASSAGE IIAs I stood by a street in Accra that late afternoon watching people rushing home from work, I felt very safe. My sense of security came from the fact that Ghanaians are generally kind and hospital people, particularly to strangers. Although I had just arrived from my village, I was a Ghanaian and in my own capital I should not fear anything.Just then, I felt a firm grip on my arm from behind. I did not feel threatened, rather I was relieved. I thought an old schoolmate must have spotted me, James Cuddle, and decided to play our old game on me. How welcome! The good old days are here again.I turned to look at the fellow in the face but the more, I turned to my left the faster he moved to my right as he tightened his grip on my wrist watch. Suddenly he let go of my arm and bolted. I saw him vanish into the thick crowd. Certain, this was not how to welcome a friend. People of the city are surely very strange!Totally confused, I made my way towards the lorry park to leave for my brother's house. In the gathering darkness, I tried to find out what time it was. To my utter surprise, I discovered that my wrist watch was gone.The rascal had made away with it. It was hardly new, not even expensive, yet the rogue found it worth stealing.6.
