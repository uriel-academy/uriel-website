PASSAGE IIApart from foods which supply us with energy, we need certain substances called protein to help us grow, and when we are fully grown, to maintain our strength. These proteins are found in meat, fish, eggs, milk, green vegetables and to a much lesser extent in grains like millet, wheat, guinea corn, rice, etc.Children fed chiefly on roots will, therefore, stop growing. They often get very ill and die while children who are given milk and eggs grow well and live longer.However, cow milk is expensive in West Africa and in many places there is a wrong tradition about eggs. Some old people say that if eggs are given to children they become liars. This is not true. Eggs do not make children either tell truth or lie. They are simply good food which will help the child to grow well. Also, the tradition that boys become thieves when they eat meat is not true. Both are bad traditions which have been repeated in some villages from one generation to another. So, the intelligent mother who wishes to bring up healthy children must discard them.7.
