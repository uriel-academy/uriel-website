He was so thrilled by his achievement that he glided and swerved in a beautiful display in the sky. While he was doing this, the water fell to the ground and formed rivers, lakes and streams.He still held fast unto the fire in his beak.

PASSAGE IIAs we were eagerly preparing for our special supper of roasted chicken, pepper sauce and fried yam, we heard another loud knock at the door. Papa opened the door to let in a fast-talking handsome stranger.According to him he was passing to the next village but there were no vehicles. Therefore he was stranded. My parents with their customary generosity allowed him to stay the rest of the day with us. Soon after, supper was ready. We the younger children had to eat in the kitchen, whilst my parents and the others ate in the dining room.From where we were eating we could hear and see the adults. "Now, Mr Anang," said my father, "you being the last to arrive will share the chicken," "Very well said," agreed Mr. Anang. He began by cutting the head of the chicken, which he gave to Papa saying, "You are the head of the family, so you get the head." To my mother, he said, "You are the next to the head; therefore, get the neck." My elder brother, Yoofi, and sister, Aba had wings because they were of age and would need wings to fly away from the family nest. The other two guests got the feet in order that they could walk to their destinations.
