PASSAGE IIOne day a poor fisherman went fishing and caught nothing. He was just about to go home when he felt the net suddenly grow heavy. He thought he had caught a large fish. But when he dragged it ashore, he found only a heavy copper pot sealed with lead. He took it and feeling sure it contained something valuable, he took his knife, cut the lead top and turned it upside down. For a moment nothing came out; and then it started to smoke, and this smoke slowly rose right up to the sky like a thick fog. It suddenly turned into a huge genie.'Bow down' said the genie 'and let me kill you'.'Why?' asked the fisherman. 'Have you forgotten that I set you free?''Yes, but I have sworn to kill you', said the genie. 'I'm a spirit that rebelled against the Creator and to punish me he shut me up in this copper pot. During the first century of my captivity, I swore to make anyone who freed me rich. During my second century, I swore I would grant him any three things. But after these centuries, in anger I swore to kill my liberator without mercy'.'Well, die I must', said the fisherman, 'but swear that you really were in that pot. It is too small to hold even your little finger. Unless I see it, I shall not believe it.''See then and believe' said the genie.He slowly changed back into smoke and entered the pot. The fisherman immediately put back the lead cover and three it into the sea.6.
