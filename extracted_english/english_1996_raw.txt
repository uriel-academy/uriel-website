Of late he has observed that giggling and murmuring have reared their ugly heads in the class. This time he was determined to find the cause of this naughty behaviour and discipline the culprits.Pretending not to have heard the noise, he moved to the blackboard as if to write something on it but in reality to set a trap.

He also saw one of the boys passing on a magazine to the boy next to him.With the speed of lightning, Mr. Mensah got there, asked the three boys to stand up and then searched them in order to seize the magazine. Smart though he was, the boys were even smarter, for the boy sitting next to the window had thrown the magazine onto the veranda. After a thorough search Mr. Mensah nearly gave up.It was, perhaps, an exercise book he had seen and not a magazine.
