What could the matter be? The pupils, bumping into each other, raced to the assembly hall. In less than a minute, Mr Amoh, the headmaster, stood with a grim face before them. He raised his hand and everybody was quiet."Children," he began. "The reason why I have summoned you here is to tell you that, at long last, we have found the students who stole the school's microphones. Bring them here!" he commanded.Necks craned to catch a glimpse of the thieves. There was Kofi Smith, the best footballer in the school. Eyes popped out. "Shiee!" exclaimed the students, completely surprised. Next was Akwesi Ameko. "What...!" blurted out someone from the back. "Is he not the Form Two Class Prefect?"

PASSAGE IIBefore Obu left the house that morning for the Christmas service, he tried on his brand new clothes together with a cap which was beautifully embroidered with yellow thread. He wore the cap at various angles, using a hand mirror to choose the most suitable.During the service, Obu caught himself several times admiring his clothes. Whenever the congregation sat down, he switched his attention from the clothes to his shoes, nicknamed "stand by", his first pair ever. He was not alone. Even the choristers who should have joined the procession preferred to sit with the rest of the congregation in order to show off their new clothes. The church itself was in a festive mood, beautifully decorated with palm fronds and flowers.Obu's only problem was that he could not wear his cap inside the church. Outside, the harmattan wind was dry and dusty, making one thirsty. One could not even smile without bleeding since one‟s lips were so dry. Despite this, Obu preferred staying outside to being inside the church where he could not display his cap.
