PASSAGE IIWe can have close friends for a very long time. But when friendship and duty come into conflict, as I once experienced, many problems may occur.Almost all my friends and I are leading members of our school's Supporters Club. In the beginning of our final year it was time to elect new officers for the club. Everyone stood the chance of being elected.When I was elected as President, I knew it would be a tough job because I would be in charge of my closest friends. The real test would come when the sports season started.Just as I had imagined, there were many disputes. No one listened to what I said. Everyone just wanted to have fun instead of cheering our athletes. I knew I had to motivate them and use discipline and that was exactly what I did.Many of my friends could not understand this. While some of them stopped coming to the games others were not talking to me at all.I finally decided to have a talk with everyone. I frankly admitted that I did not like the job but since I had it, I was determined to do my best.
