These were signs of rain and the children were beside themselves with joy. Then they burst into yet another song.The rains will soon come.The sky will be bright.And the guns will boom.As they sang and danced, they were soon joined by their parents in their happiness. It was six months since it had last rained and all that time the farmers prayed for rain that would not come.

PASSAGE IITeacher Amu never lost the opportunity to give pep-talks to his students. Variety is the spice of life, he often began. Then he would tell them how life has opposites, like good and bad. He would talk about the variety of birds, the different kinds of fish and species of trees. His students could always tell when teacher Amu's sermons were about to end. He would raise his voice and look up as he make his point: "God made them all and He said. 'It is good'."These words had a lasting effect on his students. When the class was over, they would go on reeling with laughter as they recited these words. Soon, it was not surprising when they began to call Teacher Amu. 'God made them all' whenever his back was turned.But one of them, Kofi Abre, did not consider Teacher Amu's pep-talk funny at all. He was not amused that his classmates joked with his teacher's words. Teacher Amu has said that the world was made up of different things, different people and different habits.
