COMPREHENSIONRead the following passages carefully and answer the questions that follow.PASSAGE IWhen Suzzie's mother told her that she would attend school in Ghana, she wept bitterly because she had learned that Ghana was a backward country with no good schools, no good roads and little food. She would miss not only her parents but also her friends and wonderful things in America. But her father insisted that she must leave for Ghana because it was necessary for her to learn the culture and language of her motherland, in addition to those of her fatherland if she should have a balanced education. So, Suzzie left for school in Ghana.Suzzie had been enrolled in international school for only a year, but she already had a lot of influence on her schoolmates. Her arrival on the first day had caused much excitement. Although her mother was black, her skin was as white as her father's. In fact she was the only white girl in the school and this attracted many of the girls to her, while some of the boys avoided her. In the early days, her mates found it difficult to understand her American brand of English while she also wondered how they could so easily dance to the beat of the local drums. But as time passed they learned from one another and Suzzie's white skin ceased to be odd. They ate together, played together, and enjoyed school together.Soon Suzzie began to dread the thought that she might be asked to go back to her parents. She had become a complete Ghanaian and hoped they would not ask her to return to America.1.
