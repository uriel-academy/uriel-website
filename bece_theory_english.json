Many people thought and said I was troublesome. Prominent among those who described me as such was my aunt, Araba Oboshea.\n\n \n\nAunt Araba was particularly mean. She would sit on her stool under the gum tree in front of the house and wait for me to return from wherever i had gone. As soon as I arrived she would call me and, without asking me any question or telling me anything, take my left ear between the forefinger and the thumb of her right hand and give my ear a silence, violent twist. I cannot describe the pain I endured. She would do the same to my right ear. She explained that she was paying for my absence that I had sold to her! Aunt Araba would continue to twist both ears of mine simultaneously with her forefingers and thumbs.\n\n \n\nI would scream silently, gritting my teeth so that I could not not utter any sound because of pain. That way I was spared the next stage of being given countless strokes of any stick she could lay hands on. One strange thing about Aunt Araba was that she would never hit me with her hands.\n\n \n\nAunt Araba went on treating me this way because she could hardly understand why I was always on the move. I could also not have the courage to explain why it was so because I was afraid of her and began to hate her.\n\n \n\nOn Thursday evening when I was going through my usual ordeal, an elderly man, Agya Manu who usually visited her appeared on the scene. He pleaded with her to leave me, and asked for the reason for such punishment. After he had been told my 'sin', Agya Manu, who knew me very well, explained to my auntie that I was always on the move not because I was in any bad company, but because I was the favourite for the errand. I had been running several errands for him and many other people. Agya Manu then advised me not to spend all my time running errands for others but rather, do all my duties at home.\n\n \n\n(a) What was the writer's behaviour when he was about eleven years old?\n\n \n\n(b) ..................I was always on the move.\n\nWhat is the meaning of this expression?\n\n \n\n(c) From the passage, what is the character of Aunt Araba?\n\n \n\n(d) Why did Aunt Araba keep punishing the writer?\n\n \n\n(e) How did Agya Manu rescue the writer?\n\n \n\n(f) For each of the following words, give one word or phrase which means the same:\n\nI. endured;\n\nII. countless.",

'Indeed, some people are lucky!' he added, and pulled out a crumpled cigarette and a box of matches.\n\n \n\n'I'd rather you didn't come smoke here. I keep my air fresh,' Kofi politely ordered.

Indeed, it has ruined several communities particularly in the developing countries. It must therefore be prevented at all cost.\n\n \n\nThe disease is general spread by germs which thrive in filthy and unhygienic areas. There could be an outbreak of cholera when drinking water becomes polluted by floods after a downpour. Human carriers also cause the disease to spread from place to place. For example, a person carrying the cholera germs would vomit or pass frequent stools. Flies would then carry the germs on their hairy legs and deposit them on exposed food or in water. When a person eats this contaminated food or drinks the polluted water, he or she is likely to contract the disease unknowingly.\n\n \n\nOn the whole, the main symptoms of cholera are severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which may result in loss of weight. The stool tends to be watery. As a lot of fluid is lost from the body, the patient quickly becomes dehydrated, thin and weak. The rapid loss of body fluid can soon result in death, unless the lost fluid is replaced immediately.\n\n \n\nThe first thing for the patient to do is replenish as much fluid as is lost by taking, from time to time, boiled water which has been allowed to cool and mixed with salt and sugar. Then, he should seek medical attention.\n\n \n\n(a) Where do cholera germs usually breed?\n\n \n\n(b) Mention the two main carriers of cholera germs.\n\n \n\n(c)I.

He lifted the cup and said, slowly and calmly, 'Nana, look...................!' Nana Apo barked, 'yes, it's hot. Drink it right now!' But Ananse kept a cool head. Then, in the full glare of all present, he shook the cup vigorously for some time in order to cool its content. After this, he began to sip the now-lukewarm water as if it was still hot. Between the sips, the pain he seemed to be going through made him frown. He shut the left eye and his right eye shone brightly. He deliberately let his left hand drop loosely by his side.\n\n \n\nNana Apo smiled. Queen Amola grinned. Adiefe giggled-all in happy anticipation of Ananse's failure.\n\n \n\nSuddenly Ananse began to drink the warm water more quickly and noisily. Soon, all was gone. He turned the cup upside down towards Nana and, indeed, there was not a single drop in it. Lo and behold, Kweku Ananse, the notorious trickster, had succeeded where all others has failed. There was complete silence. Even the wind seemed to have stopped blowing. The impossible had happened and people's expectation that Kweku Ananse would lose the contest had failed. Eventually, Kweku Ananse's victory had won him the hand of the pretty Princess, Adiefe.\n\n \n\nNana Apo and Queen Amola, with great relunctace, led their daughter, Adiefe, and handed her over to victorious Kweku Ananse.\n\n \n\n(a) What was the attitude of the people present before the contest?\n\n \n\n(b) Why do you think Ananse shook the cup?\n\n \n\n(c) State the three tricks Ananse used to show that he was in pain.\n\n \n\n(d)I.

At first, she went with Rikku's mother to hawk the sour milk, she was beginning to find her way to and from town.\n\n \n\nFatimeh was always chewing tobacco flower and so her lips, teeth and gums became red.

They had just one cassava farm left to feed on. The maize in the barn was all gone. In fact, they had started eating the seed maize. Sentu kept wondering how he would get seeds to plant when the rainy season eventually started. He went to inspect the traps he had set for the rodent that had been feasting on the cassava. If the traps caught any animals, it would be a double blessing; he would get meat and reduce the population of 'his enemies', the pests. While inspecting his traps, h saw some smoke. He dashed towards it. He tried to put out the fire but could not. He shouted for help. In a twinkling of an eye, the whole farm had been destroy. Sentu wept uncontrollably.\n\n \n\nWhen he raeched the village, his neighbours rushed to his house to console him. They gave him foodstuff and promised to help him get back on his feet. Tutu, the palm-wine tapper, visited Sentu that evening. He was accompanied by two elderly and highly respected men in the village. Their mission was simple.

In the name of natural resource development, land is given to mining companies owned by foreigners. These foreigners milk the country dry and destroy the heritage of the people.\n\n \n\nFrom the vast concessions granted them by the government, they extract the gold, destroy the rivers and other water bodies in the communities before going home, leaving the land worthless. Yet their operations are legal.\n\n \n\nApproved mining is, however, not the sole gold mining activity. There is also what is regarded as unauthorized mining, called galamsey. In this enterprise, adventurous Ghanaians set out to do private mining as a livelihood. They dig up the earth with tools that are not as sophisticated as those of foreigners who also dig for the precious metal.\n\n \n\nMining activities destroy the environment. So far, it appears that nothing can be done to reclaim the land degraded by miners; the damage is irreversible. Vast tracts of arable land have become desolate mounds because of gold digging. Nothing can grow where galamsey has taken place.\n\n \n\nBesides, the main water sources of communities have been polluted by the activities of both legal and illegal miners. The gold extracted from dirt requires cleaning with chemicals and rinsing in water. By the time the gold searchers succeed in producing a glittering handful, large stretches of rivers, ponds of water and some lakes have become poisoned.\n\n \n\nPollution leaves little drinking water for man and beast. Fishes die and human contract various diseases.\n\n \n\n(a) Name the types of mining activities discussed in the passage.\n\n \n\n(b)I. Which groups of people engage in mining?\n\n(b)II.

At school, some people develop friendly relationships which continue throughout their lives. One thing which helps people to stay together as intimate friends is the ability to communicate freely among themselves and endeavour to be each other's keeper. What destroys friendships mostly is friends being suspicious of each other. That is why a popular adage says, \"Suspicious is the bane of friendship\".\n\n \n\nPeople attend school not only because they want to make friends but also to acquire knowledge and skills for employment. Education helps people to be polished in their manners. The school prepares its students to become useful citizens.\n\n \n\nAt school, Tono was not in good books of the teachers because he behaved in an unruly manner. Initially, everyone avoided his company; he could be violent at times. Worst of all, he would refuse todo his assignment and was a habitual late comer. With the passage of time, he was subjected to strict discipline. He began to amend his ways and obey the school's rules and regulation. He realised the need to work diligently in order to have a bright future. His academic work there improved by leaps and bounds.\n\n \n\nFortune separated us. I travelled abroad for further studies. I stay away for two decades. On my return, I went to my former school for my certificate. There, I met a middle-age gentleman who also came to the office for the same purpose. I could not recognize him because time had wiped off all memories of school life. However, the names on the certificates revealed that we were classmates.\n\n \n\nAfter further discussion, Tono invited me to his business partner.\n\n \n\n(a)I.

Students knew the essence of education and made efforts to achieve excellence. Reading whatever material, they came across not only helped thier mental development but also made them self-reliant and confident. Students burn the midnight oil in order to make grades and to come out of the school as better people.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, the same cannot be said of students today. Whatever students achieved in the past is considered archaic. The emergence of improver technology has bedevilled the society. Students prefer staying in touch with friends and loved ones. The use of social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram, has taken over their entire being. Reading useful materials like dailies, storybooks and others is now a thing of the past.\n\n \n\nThe negative influence of social media has deprived students of achieving excellence. Examination malpractices, mass failure in examination and bad language have become the order of the day.\n\n \n\nModern technology has its own benefits. In addition to serving as a great tool for businesses, it enables students to access informations easily. What is more, it enables easy interactions between friends and loved ones. As much as these are important, students should realise that, without good moral practices, education and reading, the future remains blurred. Students can eradicate the negative effects of modern technology has on them if only they remain focussed on their academic work.\n\n \n\n(a) State two benefits of reading mentioned in the passage.\n\n \n\n(b) For what two reasons did students study late into the night in the past?\n\n \n\n(c) State two benefits of modern technology.\n\n \n\n(d) How can students get rid of the harmful influence of social media?\n\n \n\n(e) Explain in your own words the following expressions as used in the passage:\n\nI.

The tiger is the largest member of the family. Although it is a wild animal, it is sometimes trained to assist acrobatic in entertaining people. The chectah is the fastest animal on land. It can be trained to hunt other animals. Cats are found in many homes but there are wild ones too.\n\nAlthough cats are found in many homes, man did not intentionally domesticate them. Before man learnt to grow crops and rear animals, he used to depend on plants and animals in the bush for food. When he gathered grains, which were seeds of grass, he accidentally took away the food of the rodents such as mice and rats. These followed their foods indoors. The wild cat, the natural enemy of the rats and mice, also followed the the domestic granaries\n\nCats did not eat the grains that were becoming the main source of nourishment for man. Therefore, they were encouraged to remain at home in order to get rid of the rodents. Man, also probably found out that cats were neater and quieter than dogs.\n\nWhen ships were invented and man began to trade farther, grains were very important commodities. They were used not only as provisions but as items of barter. The mice and the rats went along, once again followed by the cats.

His children were very dear to him but he did not pamper them. He considered some modern gadgets dangerous, too expensive and a way of encouraging laziness among children. Therefore, no labour-saving gadgets were found in the kitchen. He insisted that food tasted better when prepared in the traditional way. He was also his children's barber.\n\nAt school, his children were the only pupils who received letters, popularly called snail mail. Akwesi, his eldest child, was always the object of ridicule among his peers. He patiently bore all the humiliation. When he completed school and his father made him manage his business, he decided to do things differently. He bought a cellular phone for his mother and equipped the house with modern gadgets. He also installed tracking devices on his father's vehicles and insisted on the drivers using mobile money transfer services. He swore the drivers to secrecy.\n\nIn an era when car snatching, drivers cheating their employers and armed robbery were the order of the day. Ogboo's transport business continued to flourish.

She was also pleased with the staff and student population. However, one thing puzzled her. The students' performance was very poor, according to the records. She had a discussion with the staff who complained of student absenteeism due to ill health. A nurse in the community told her that the children were often under the weather.\n\nThey had malaria, although every family had been given insecticide-treated mosquito nets. It seemed however that the people did not use these nets as they should and therefore the numerous mosquitoes in the environment continued to bite them. While visiting some of the sick children in the community, the Headmistress noticed that there were several pits filled with water. At a general PTA meeting, she explained how mosquitoes could breed in the stagnant water in the pits. She also pointed out the effects of the poor health of the children on their academic performance. She then appealed for help to destroy the breeding places of the mosquitoes so that the children would become healthier and perform better in school.\n\nAlthough some of the parents did not understand the connection between the water in the pits and the performance of the students, they agreed to help her. During the next dry season, work started. All hands were on deck. The people worked very hard and the pits were filled. Trees and flowers were planted on the reclaimed land.

Migration of human beings has both positive and negative effects on individuals in the society.\n\nWhen Bello migrated to the city, he left his wife, Aisha, an enterprising traditional career, to fend for herself and their two children. During one of his occasional visits home, his father asked him to take his wife and children to live with him in the city. Reluctantly, Bello gave in.\n\nAisha had imagined that she would be living in a neat, beautiful and comfortable house in the city. Instead, she, her husband and their children were accomodated in a single room. Washroom facilities were shared with other families. To worsen her plight, her housekeeping allowance was so meagre that she could hardly feed her family properly. She wanted to work, but like the other female migrants, she could not find any job. She wondered how they would survive, be able to send money to their parents and save for a rainy day.\n\nOne day, she decided to give her husband a treat and also socialize with their friends. She prepared one of the most inexpensive but tasty delicacies of her people and shared it with her neighbours. Even passers-by popped in for a bite. It was a very successful get together. Her labour was not in vain. Soon, other women asked her to teach them how to cook some local dishes. She also provided catering services at many events. She was handsomely rewarded. Gradually, Aisha Catering Services became a household name and there was remarkable improvement in their lives.\n\n(a)\n\n \n\nWhat was Aisha's occupation before she went to the city?\n\n(b)\n\n \n\nIn which two ways did migrant workers spend their money?\n\n(c)\n\n \n\nIn one adjective, describe how Aisha felt when she arrived in the city.\n\n(d)\n\n \n\n\"Reluctantly, Bello gave in\"\n\nWhy was Bello reluctant?\n\n(e)\n\n \n\nExplain in your own words the following expressions as used in the passage:\n\n(i)\n\n \n\n... to fend for;\n\n(ii)\n\n \n\nsave for a rainy day;\n\n(iii)\n\n \n\nwas not in vain.\n\n(f)\n\n \n\nFor each of the following words, give another word or phrase that means the same and can fit into the passage:\n\n(i)\n\n \n\noccasional;\n\n(ii)\n\n \n\nprepared;\n\n(iii)\n\n \n\nhandsomely;\n\n(iv)\n\n \n\nimprovement.\n\n(g)\n\n \n\nIn two sentences of not more than ten words each, summarize two problems that migrants face as expressed in the third paragraph.\n\n   \n\nPART CLITERATURE[10 marks]\n\nAnswer all the questions in this part.\n\nSACKEY J.A and DARMANI L.

I asked my father to explain them to me. His explanation impressed me so I resolved to make them my hallmarks. I tried to be as good as my words. Anytime I was rude or showed disloyalty to someone, I promptly regretted it. Soon, loyalty and decorum became characteristic of me.\n\nHaving completed Junior High School, my uncle, Gidi, approached my father and requested that I lived with him temporarily as his children were in America in search of greener pastures. With Daddy's consent, I went and stayed with him. However, he refused to let me return to my parents after Senior High School. Why? Daddy impressed on me the value of hardwork so I lived up to expectation.\n\nUncle decided to visit his children for the best part of a year and left his mansion and other properties under the stewardship of Lugu, his security man and me due to the trust he reposed in us. This notwithstanding, Lugu suggested we connive with some miscreants to burgle Uncle Gidi's house and share the proceeds with them. Though he persistently attempted to persuade me, I never bought into that idea. Eventually, he fled the mansion sensing I might expose him as a traitor.\n\nUncle returned and heard about Lugu's plan which I did not succumb to and promised to reward me substantially. However, this never materialized until the unexpected happened. His children returned and told me that when Uncle Gidi was about to go to eternity, he instructed them to reward me with a three-bedroom house and a car. All I said was \"oh! loyalty.\"\n\n(a)\n\n \n\nWhat is the difference between the narrator and Lugu, according to the passage?\n\n(b)\n\n \n\nWhy didn't the narrator's uncle let him or her go back to his or her parents' house after Senior High School?\n\n(c)\n\n \n\nWhy didn't the narrator agree to Lugu's suggestion?\n\n(d)\n\n \n\n\"Until the unexpected happened\"\n\nWhat do you think happened?\n\n(e)\n\n \n\nExplain in your own words the following expressions as used in the passage:\n\n(i)\n\n \n\nBe as good as my words;\n\n(ii)\n\n \n\nin search of greener pastures;\n\n(iii)\n\n \n\nthe best part of a year.\n\n(f)\n\n \n\nFor each of the following words, give another word or phrase that means the same and can fit into the passage:\n\n(i)\n\n \n\nprompty;\n\n(ii)\n\n \n\nstewardship;\n\n(iii)\n\n \n\nburgle;\n\n(iv)\n\n \n\nsubstantially.\n\n(g)\n\n \n\nIn two sentences of not more than ten words each,\n\n(i)\n\n \n\nsummarize a lesson the narrator learnt based on the last paragraph;\n\n(ii)\n\n \n\ngive a suitable title to the passage.\n\n  \n\nPART C\n\nLITERATURE\n\n[10 marks]\n\nAnswer all the questions in this part.\n\nSACKEY J.A. and DARMANI L.
