      "content": "When Mr. Appiah looked at the two happy faces of his nephews, he forgot about his aching feet and smiled. He had spent the whole day showing Asare and Attah, who came from the village, around Accra. He was satisfied that they were happy. It was not until they were seated on a bench in the public garden that he realized how hot, tired and dusty he was.It was a long time since he had walked so much. Like many other successful men, Mr. Appiah had acquired the habit of going everywhere in his car, so that day's sight-seeing expedition had worn him out.\"Well, what do you think of Accra?\"He asked the boys.\"Oh!\" exclaimed Attah. \"it's a wonderful place!\"\"I didn't imagine any place could be like this, Uncle\" said Asare, \"Everything is so splendid. The roads are very wide and the buildings magnificent\".\"Boys, don't get the wrong impression. Today you've seen the best parts of our city, but there are bad areas with buildings falling apart, narrow streets and insanitary conditions. However, these buildings are being demolished\", said Mr. Appiah.",

      "content": "The Akosombo Dam and the great Volta Lake are famous over the world. The two main reasons for building the dam were, to generate electricity and to use the electricity for the production of aluminium from bauxite.Aluminium is used throughout the world; so both the production of electricity and the production of aluminium are of great value to Ghana.It may seem strange to talk about producing electricity by building a dam, but in fact a lot of dams have been built all over the world for this purpose. What happens is that a concrete wall, called a dam, is constructed across a river at a narrow point. A large lake then develops behind the wall. Tunnels are made in the dam so that water from the lake can rush fiercely through them. This powerful flow of water is used to drive huge machines called turbines, to generate electricity. All that the engineers need is the water rushing down from the lake, and all this costs them nothing! But of course the building of the dam and the fixing of the machines cost a great deal of money.Big dams have been built in many parts of the world. The Akosombo Dam is one of the biggest. However, the lake, which has been formed, is in fact the biggest man-made lake in the world.",
